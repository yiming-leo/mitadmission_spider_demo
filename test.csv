[Guest Post] 202.9 (slightly cursed) Tims from the Class of ‘29,Ellie F. '28,10 ,"December 11, 2025","I was bored, so I made 202.9 Tim ideas suggested by the Class of ‘29 Discord Server! I was originally going to draw 2029 Tims for the class of 2029, but I ran out of time. Maybe that will come in the future. Anyway, enjoy–or shudder in fear; some of these are truly cursed.
We have a Wide Tim, so why not a Long Tim?
Tim Count: 1
Time Tim! Tim Count: 2
Tim and Jerry (Jerry keeps stealing Tim’s Psets >:() Tim Count: 3
OpTIMus Prime! He turns into the Great Dome police car as his vehicle form (is that what it’s called? idk I don’t know Transformers) Tim Count: 4
Spherical Tim (in a vacuum) – he’s reaching for the stars! Tim Count: 5
Unicorn Tim! This may be the least cursed Tim I’ve ever drawn. Tim Count: 6
Tim Cook – I actually didn’t know who he was before I was given this idea–apparently he’s the current CEO of Apple. Tim Count: 7
InTIMidating Tim! Tim Count: 8
Timothée Chalamet–as seen in Dune. Tim Count: 9
The eTIMology of Tim! Tim Count: 13
TIMpani! Tim Count: 14
Quantum entangled Tims! Tim Count: 16
Oh no, Tim has been the vicTIM of a gruesome crime! Just kidding, that’s actually ketchup. Tim Count: 17
Enjoy Tim eating his favorite snack–a natural log!
Tim Count: 18
The existence of Long Tim and Wide Tim also implies the existence of a Deep Tim.
Tim Count: 19
Tim has DEEPENED. (I got access to a sticker machine >:))
Tim Count: 199
It takes a LONG TIM to graduate from MIT. Do multiple Long Tims help you graduate faster?
Tim Count: 200
Imagine this slithering straight at you…
Tim Count: 201
More Long Tim!
Tim Count: 202
A physical manifestation of Long Tim.
Tim Count: 203
I dropped him :(
Tim Count: 202.9","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-1.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-2-1000x1365.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-3-1000x676.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-4-1000x1136.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-5-1000x1425.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-6-1000x1411.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-7-1000x1486.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-8-1000x1055.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-9-1000x1094.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-a-1000x1090.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-b-1000x1240.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-c-1000x347.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-d-1000x684.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-e.gif', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-g.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-h.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-i-1.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-f.gif', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-k.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-l.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tim-m.jpg']"
"MIT EA Decisions to be Posted Tuesday, 12/16/25, at 6:28 PM ET",Ceri R. '16,13 ,"December 9, 2025","I’m here today, accompanied by Tim’s very hardworking cousin, to announce that Early Action decisions for the Class of 2030 will be released next Tuesday, 12/16/2025, at 6:28 PM ET. 
To check your decision on the 16th, visit apply.mitadmissions.org/apply and go to your Application Status Page. That’s the same place that you’ve been tracking your application checklist, which will now be turned off. Your decision will be awaiting you there, behind a button that says “View Update.” Make sure that you are ready to receive your decision, whatever it may be, before you press that button.
In order to help logistically prepare yourself, I recommend you practice logging in now so you don’t run into any issues next Tuesday. If you need to reset your password, just go to apply.mitadmissions.org/apply, click the link to Log In, then click “Forgot Your Password?” and follow the instructions. If you still need help after that, feel free to email admissions@mit.edu and someone from our team will get back to you!
Admissions decisions will be available exclusively online. Decisions will not be released via email, skywriting, snail telegraph, carrier pigeon, balloon mail, or intergalactic radio broadcast. However, we will be sending admitted students additional, cylindrical information in the near future.
When Early Action decisions are released, we’ll be here on these blogs with open threads for you to chat with admissions officers, bloggers, and other applicants. You don’t have to be alone if you don’t want to be.
Until then, I hope you try to immerse yourself in moments of joy and curiosity, rather than being consumed by the Waiting of it all. Hala K. ’29 made this playlist to keep you company as the time passes. I’ll see you on the other side of decisions!",[]
2.009 LIVE BLOG 2025,Taylor L. '29,2 ,"December 8, 2025","7:24 — HELLO WORLD AND WELCOME TO THE 2.009 LIVE BLOG!!!!!!!! This is Kayode, here with Veronica and Taylor, fellow Bloggers!! We’ll be writing about the showcase as it happens, so follow along! Like! Comment! Subscribe!!
Follow along with the LIVE PRESENTATION at this link: https://www.009cycles.com/webcast
“But wait, what even is the 2.009 presentation?” Glad you asked! 2.009 – “Produce Engineering Process” is MIT’s Senior Year capstone course for Mechanical Engineering. Seniors spend the semester designing a real product that gets presented during this presentation. And many go on to become real products, like the Avive AED Defibrillator, which started as a 2.009 project and now is spreading to campuses across the nation!
7:31 – HI IT’S TAYLOR. Kayode’s keyboard is broken so the exclamation marks don’t work, but just insert them wherever they feel appropriate in your mind. Ridonkulous, one of MIT’s amazing dance groups, is on the stage now and they are killing it. The whole auditorium is decked out in a bunch of different colors right now, including their outfits. The vibes are good.
Also, while we were waiting for the show to start, I was doing some thinking and came up with a pickup line. We may be watching 2.009, but you’re two-double-oh fine. Feel free to use this.
7:41- Hey it’s Veronica!!!! We’re sitting next to my floor, and we printed out giant cardboard heads of two of my friends! I’ve watched my floor friends present every year, and it’s so crazy to think that next year it’ll be my turn to be up there. The production value on 2.009 always wows me, and the presenters just pulled off an insanely quick outfit change.
WOOOO
Anyways, Green Team’s presentation is starting now, so excited to see what they came up with!
8:52 — Back to Kayode…with a short word from Janet [who was on the liveblog last year and wants to be included 🙄]:
“good to (not actually) see you guys again! some of my group projects are flopping so i had to flop on this group project to work on the other ones xoxo thanks for carrying kayode 😄 if the quality of this liveblog gets worse you know why (i’m not on the liveblog) and if the quality of this liveblog gets better you know why (i’m on it, spiritually, guiding the lost travelers on blah blah blah)”
Thanks, Janet!!
Green Team: Green Team has developed an automated CPR Chest Compression robot called Heart Bridge. It can be taken from a nearby bench and quickly deployed to provide chest compressions and life saving care during the critical time that emergency services are traveling to the scene.
They used a CPR dummy for the demonstration. It lived!!
8:01 – Taylor here, and I’m taking over for the Purple Team. Kayode’s laptop started tweaking out, so we switched to mine, and I can use exclamation marks again!
8:07 – We took an intermission to set up the stage, because Purple Team was working on a product in the agriculture field. Can we take a moment to appreciate the amazing set?
Purple Team’s product, AgriSweep, helps apple farmers to harvest their crops more efficiently. AgriSweep is a cart that attaches to the back of a tractor, which connects to the tractor’s own hydraulics. It has rotating sweepers that can pick apples up off the ground, a ladder-like conveyor to lift them up, and produce bins to collect them. It automatizes the process, which is usually pretty labor intensive.
8:23- Veronica again! After a lovely performance by the Ohms, it’s time for Red Team.
Red Team developed Scribbly, a product that helps streamline the sketch process in hand embroidery. Users upload an image into an intuitive online interface—which uses edge detection to convert a full color image to an embroidery-friendly sketch— and Scribbly draws the image directly onto the fabric!!! Scribbly was designed to function on a range of fabrics, hoop sizes, and pen types. For the live demo, we got to watch Scribbly draw the MIT MechE logo!!!
I’m impressed by how user-friendly the product is, and you could tell that Red Team had really worked hard to develop a good sense of teamwork— you could tell they had lots of love for their product. Super cool!!!
8:48 – Kayode time :]. And Blue Team Time!! These teams are all so impressive.
Blue Team designed Dori, a deployable propellor guard for use on motorized boats. With Dori, the boat’s propellor can be covered when near people fallen into the water, and lifted when the boat needs to move faster. This gives the safety benefits of having a guard without the sluggish movement that fixed guards typically bring. It also involves no drill mounting, and doesn’t void any warranties!!
They brought a whole boat up here
9:05 – It’s Kayode. I had teh realization that me and Janet wrote a lot more last year because we were arguing the whole time. So i’ve decided to start beef.
Oh wait, MIT Live is performing! They’re doing Cant Stop by Red Hot Chili Peppers.
YELLOW TEAM!!!!!!!
9:12 – Taylor back. Kayode was trying to cover two teams in a row, and he failed to start beef. I’d say that’s because Veronica and I are above him and his antics, but he’s just so tall that I can’t.
Also, Aarushi M. ’26 asked “what does any of this have to do with cycles?” I don’t know either.
Anyways, back to the scheduled programming. YELLOW TEAM!!!
Yellow Team’s product helps people who want to make ice rinks out of snow. Their product, Polar, paves over icy areas and makes it into a functional ice rink. It has blades that cut the ice, and it gets rid of the imperfections with hot water, which ensures that the skating surface is all nice and smooth. I think it’s like a portable push zamboni.
As a side note, it’s getting cold up here in Boston (16 degrees right now 😬), so this feels very appropriate for the weather. MIT has its own ice rink (Johnson! The figure skating club did a showcase there last night), but maybe next time they can use Polar and skate outside.
Someone just asked, “How heavy is Polar? How do you know it won’t fall through a frozen lake?” And the response was, “Well, it’s 200 pounds, and that’s lighter than most people.”
The paver cut into the both the ice and board, but I think that just means it works well.
 
9:30- Veronica again, two hooligans, Seth R. ’27 and Felipe A. ’27 are jousting with pom poms right next to me. Public shaming is in order.
Pink Team is the last team! Reality is slowly sinking in as I realize I still have an assignment to work on after this. Probably going to crack open the RedBull in my bag (Fuji Apple and Ginger flavor— pretty underrated).
Anyways, onto Pink Team. They’ve brought a real rescue diver onto the stage!!! Pink Team’s product, HydroHold, helps rescue divers recover victims in a hands-free manner by securing a strap around their chest. Their main goals were to make a “simple & safe” product. The crowd participation throughout this whole show has been really entertaining: who would’ve thought a “double carabiner” would get a huge whoop!
GOOD JOB HANNAH E ROSE!!!!!!!!! – kayode
9:47 “Kayode, you suck. If I had the Hydrohold, I still wouldn’t save you” – Taylor trying to start beef to make this more interesting… youch!
9:55 OK, fun stuff!! See you guys next year!!!","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-from-Slack-400x300.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/green-team-400x300.jpeg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9502-400x300.jpeg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-from-Slack-1-400x300.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blue-team-400x300.jpeg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yellow-team-400x300.jpeg']"

2.009 LIVE BLOG 2025",[]
day in my life except it’s a live blog,Victor D. '27,5 ,"December 7, 2025","11:07-11:33 PM: i got distracted again. here’s what i did the past few hours:
read a chapter from Orbital by Samantha Harvey which is the last book for my reading seminar (infrastructure systems in theory and practice). so far it’s incredibly beautiful but harsh (it’s about a crew of astronauts on the ISS). maybe i’ll write a post about it in a similar vein to my first post which used Onlooking as a springboard.
added 4 movies to my letterboxd that i have been procrastinating on (two from my globalization in latin america class [ixcancul, noches de fuego], fnaf 2 because on friday i went to see it with friends, and Pickpocket which i saw as part of an urban planning film series that one of my professors puts on). i’ve gotten more into documentation recently since when people ask stuff like “what kind of movies do you watch” or “what kind of books do you like” i realize i’m pretty bad at organizing this kind of information so i just freeze up, unable to recall the information in what feels like a socially acceptable period of time. being more intentional about what i’m consuming and meditating on i think has been really productive for me.
started drafting my article for transportation planning and policy class (which was the subject of the first half of this live blog). it needs to be done by 4 pm tomorrow ;-;
refactored code for my deep learning final project. this needs to be done by tuesday. everything works out in the end.
sent some emails for club stuff (vgo)
responded to my mom’s text
talked to my friend about an essay he’s writing for his class
i’m not sure how to phrase this in a way that doesn’t come off as tone-deaf but sometimes i feel like i’m not doing anything. ironically even though im supposed to be blogging about my life here i often feel like my episodic memory has been really poor recently compared to my peers–or at least my recall is extremely slow (maybe it’s all in my head). at the same time, maybe it’s just that im so caught up in the whirlwind of everything im doing that i don’t have time to really stop and process what exactly is happening to me. it’s an incessant ray of energy blasting you forward even as you try to dig your heels in the sand and stop for a second–the moment already zipped by before you could register it.
this live blogging experiment was fun cause i know i’ll recall this day very well for many years to come. it wasn’t particularly “novel” but overall i enjoyed it (despite the sleep deprivation part that nerfed me). even though i probably won’t do this again because the nature of live blogging alienates you from the present, at the same time, i feel a lot more secure in being able to recall and relish in what i did today, rather than the memories blurring under the frenetic energy forcing me through my life here.
this is a lot of words to say that i’ve been neglecting my diary.
8:12 PM: ended up going to maseeh dining and chilling with people from east campus and then moved tables to talk with friends from mariachi. mostly talked about languages, specifically spanish and portuguese & differences between the european and latin american variants. overall dining was fine i had rice and curry cauliflower.
perhaps i should not have stayed so long given that i have many projects left to do but giving myself less time to complete a task will only help me work more efficiently (jk, unless).
6:48 PM: at mariachi rehearsal my ipad died so reading music off my phone and i forgot my glasses so couldn’t see it really. but really fun overall still. played los machetes, se me olvidó otra vez, la negra, deja que salga la luna, un poco loco y sabor a mi.
4:53 PM: after the vgo exec meeting, i went to the mariachi rehearsal room but there’s people in there rn i should’ve just gotten boba at teado instead of coming early 😞. just sitting on a bench in building 4.
stopping to write; stopping to think and perceive. spending so much time here i find myself blocking out what has become quotidian. a tour group passed by and the guide gestured at the tunnels that connect main group. now 2 and a half years here–i’ve assimilated the novel as normal. can i learn to see the regular again as if im seeing it for the first time?
4:04 PM: ellie (other blogger [also in vgo]) is mad that i haven’t locked in on this. i just finished vgo rehearsal. i tried scraping a new reed for my oboe but i ende up pressing too hard with the knife and i chipped the tip :( i always feel really guilty when i miss up my reeds since it feels like im wasting cane. i have neglected to make reeds for a while so i’ve lost the touch one could say. also throwback to my mit essays cause i wrote one about making oboe reeds 😹 anyways ill need to make some more. speaking of which yall should tune into the mit vgo concert on saturday at 7:00 pm EST by searching MIT VGO on youtube and joining the live stream then!
i should probably pack my instruments (i also have my alto w me)
12:50 PM: back on putz (my hall) in east campus (my dorm), trying to figure out how to organize my thoughts around the airport transit link for the article. unfortunately this pondering will soon be truncated, as i have rehearsals from 2-4 and 5-7 for vgo (video game orchestra) and mariachi respectively, and vgo setup is at 1 so i should probably get going rn.
12:16 PM: caught the red line! it’s satisfying seeing the trains run at their intended speeds; during you freshman year, you could easily out-speedwalk the train on the longfellow bridge because it was so slow. i’m always enchanted crossing the longfellow bridge on the red line since it’s above ground, and you get to see the boston skyline towering over the charles river pass by. during the autumn the entire esplanade (the park along the charles river on the boston side) blossoms with color but it’s already that time of year where the trees have mostly shed their leaves.
12:10 PM: park street is one of the oldest subway stations in the us (opened in 1897 i think look up tremont subway). it’s also very confusing because there’s 4 separate green line lines that run through the station. now waiting for red line train
12:08 PM: green line comes into the station screeching lethargically. made my transfer from blue to red, and it’s only for one station so i can transfer back to the red line (gov center to park street).
somebody is blasting joe tex on a speaker on this train
11:59 AM: blue line train arrived. i don’t think i’ve been on the blue line this semester, since i primarily use it to get to east boston but havent had much time to do little trips this semester unfortunately. or just haven’t been super motivated to i guess.
11:53 AM: I forgot that Airport station on the blue line is outside; it’s so cold. my fingers are struggling to type this. why doesn’t the T give us those nice heated shelters on the platform like in Toronto.
11:45 AM: i feel like this airport shuttle bus has too many stops. like im still on this bus i haven’t even made my transfer to the train yet. there should be a people mover here so we don’t have t wait outside in the below freezing temperatures for the bus.
throwback to the massport plan to build a people mover at boston logan that would cost an estimated 1 billion dollars

11:39 AM: let’s document more thoughts about this. i am trying to imagine myself coming to boston for the first time by myself during sin limite (actually maybe it was the first time traveling by myself too). when i got to logan it was honestly really confusing, and i was struggling to figure out where the busses they chartered to bring us to mit were (i guess admissions might have had issues with people trying to use the T to get to MIT, or since the route isn’t super intuitive maybe it’s just nice to provide a direct route). this is actually how i met my roommate and really good friend (juarez) of two yrs (we roomed together 2 years in burton conner) bc they sent a message in the sin limite groupme saying something like “i just got on a random bus 💀” and i thought it was really funny so i reacted and responded, then we met up lol.
also throwback to them trying to blue bike to the airport that one time during freshman year
11:36 AM:
my return route requiring 3 transfers! :D (3rd option down taking 40 minutes)
An arrow pointing right

Next
11:29 AM: i probably should have done this in reverse bc taking the T from the airport is actually free (you can get on the bus for free and transfer to the red line in south station to get to Kendall/MIT). using the airport shuttle is free but then you have to pay for the transfer to the blue line at airport station. but i’ve actually never taken the airport shuttle cause it’s slower and also requires an extra transfer (as we’ve discussed below) and also now that i’m trying to do it it’s honestly kind of confusing and really cold waiting out here for the bus 😿.
11:22 AM i made it to airport. what terminal should i get off at? i haven’t fully decided. since it’s sunday there was no traffic getting here so it only took 25 minutes! pretty good. normally the bus gets stuck in the tunnel under the boston harbor and this ride takes upwards of 40 minutes (including the red line segment to the airport)
11:16 AM: overall this bus ride is fine but not smooth at all and reminds me trying to balance my suitcases and not falling over myself. silver line lore is interesting since it came about during the big dig (one of the biggest infrastructure projects in american history) as part of an environmental impacts mitigation plan. the silver line was actually originally conceived as a train but it got watered down to an articulated bus (slinky bus).
11:07 AM: reminding myself why this station is so unintuitive. there are a group of people w/ suitcases waiting at the wrong part of the platform. definitely not their fault cause there’s a cacophony of (very uninformative) signage here.
genuinely what is happening bruh 💀

11:02 AM: i just perceived that im actually in one of the old red line cars (vs the new ones that they’re rolling out [pun intended]). so much of this system feels really antiquated but i kind of vibe with the liminal 70s-90s atheistic so characteristic of this metro system.
10:57 AM: i just caught an Ashmont bound red line train (the line forks into two branches later on). in the meantime i will explain the lore. basically, there’s two metro lines that do not connect (the red and blue) despite being about ~2400 feet from each other, which means you have to make another transfer at park street station from the green then take the green one station (a couple thousand feet) to the blue line which then takes u to airport station. the route im currently taking isn’t that one but rather the one that transfers to the silver line, which tricks u into thinking it’s an actual train because it has a color and everything. but it’s a farce bc it’s actually just a bus.
10:50 AM: when i actually post this post. i got distracted eating my breakfast. it’s T time.
10:35 AM: im currently sitting in a dunkin with an ice matcha latte and croissant sandwich in kendall square, in preparation for my trip to the airport. i actually don’t have a flight lol but rather this is for one of my classes (transportation planning and policy 11.540)–we have to write an article about how to improve transit connections b/w kendall/mit station (on boston’s red line) and boston logan international airport (which has no train going to it).
my route of choice (silver line to red line). we shall take a different route on the way back (airport shuttle to blue to green to red). as you can see this is the issue we are trying to solve (10 minutes driving vs 30 on public transit)

9:40 AM: i woke up and decided i probably shouldn’t sleep to 11, even though i went to sleep at 4 ish (whoops, i promise my sleep schedule isn’t normally this bad), took a satisfying morning shower, and was on my way out of east campus by 10:15.","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/people-hate-on-the-silver-line-but-all-the-airport-issues-v0-ng3oq0p057za1-800x519.webp', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/return-800x358.png', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_4916-800x1067.jpeg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/place-800x358.png']"
passionless,Aiden H. '28,8 ,"December 7, 2025","I’m not typically one for year-end reflections or goals, mostly treating New Year’s Eve as a reason to make a charcuterie board and talk to friends instead of a day of radical change and contemplation. I mostly believe in what Lorde has said about how people don’t change day-to-day or even year-to-year, but instead every four years. That a year ago will never seem too far but four years can feel like a lifetime.
But I digress, because this year I actually do have thoughts, just noting that I say “this year” but in reality it’s just where I’m at right now, which may or may not be what I was feeling earlier in the year, or even last year.
This was a year of deduction. This is a pretty normal time in most people’s lives to feel like there are a million possibilities, and I feel like I have pretty confidently reduced the paths I feel willing to take. Nonetheless, I want a year of assertiveness, eagerness. It’s much easier to know when you want to do something rather than write something off forever.
I feel overwhelmingly passionless. If anything, my passion is searching for one, wanting so bad to have some hyper-romanticized, tortured-artist, “I-did-it-because-I-can’t-live-without-it” mindset.  I feel a lack of satisfaction, of vindication, in my life choices because I lack this internal drive for anything I could fill my day with. I’m not sure about engineering, but I’m less sure about everything else. I get a stronger and stronger feeling that this isn’t it for me, that every pset is a day wasted when I could be doing something greater. This is almost definitely self-destruction, but how am I supposed to know if I need to destroy everything around me to move on in the first place?
Famous billionaire biotech big-name and also MIT professor Robert Langer⁠01he made Moderna and a shit ton of other things came to speak to our 10.10 class.⁠02Intro to Chemical Engineering While my professors and peers were praising him, wanting so badly to be remembered, I couldn’t have cared less that he was there. Not that I don’t respect him or his time, it just wasn’t any more invigorating than a normal lecture. The way I’ve been explaining it is if you put a bunch of political science majors in a room with the president, and one kid just couldn’t care. How could you not? Is this not the peak of the career you could ask for, the greatest dream you’re setting yourself up to have?
When I allow the pipe dreams to take over, I break free from the non-existent shackles around me and become some sort of philosophical revolutionary or breakout singer or public figure or insanely popular twink actor,⁠03a la timothee chalamet, nicholas galitzine, etc. not Bob Langer. Why do I find these lives inherently more interesting than the geniuses around me? I think I am just bored by the civility and mundanity of a middle-class suburban lifestyle, but when faced with an interesting, important life that I could very reasonably attain, it garners the same level of disgust. Do I only want lives I can’t have, or do I want lives that give me the most attention? Does it matter what I do or how people view me? I must be less of a pessimist than I thought, believing that these fantasies are possible, much less actually desirable and fulfilling.
I just feel like I can’t say I’ve lived if I haven’t experienced everything. I want to be an engineer 1/100th of the time, and a doctor, lawyer, pop star, president, author and everything else the other 99% of the time. I fully feel able to do anything I want, so where do I start? It’s a privileged and pretentious question, but still a depressing one, feeling as if I’m always making the wrong choice. So I choose to stay still.
I found a half-baked essay vaguely about sleeping through life that I started one night in January. While most of it isn’t great, I find this paragraph mostly still resonates:
Perhaps instead I’ll be one of those heavy sleepers who eventually isn’t.  Maybe there are fame and accolades ahead of me. Once I grow old and my back hurts in the same way it always has I’ll write an autobiography detailing what was waiting outside of the twin XL with the $30 mattress topper. It all started on a hot summer night, I’ll write, because naturally nothing happens in our lives during the cold winter except bundling up to protect ourselves and the cycles of human hibernation. I was in a bar on the Lower East Side, two places I have never been to, and it is because I have never been to them that I can think of them this way: means of a better life that are, for the moment, inconceivable. Of course I wouldn’t write about the years in which I slept. That’s not what people are interested in. I’ll write in a passing note in the introduction how “my childhood years were spent in a typical fashion” and they were “nothing of interest”. I’ll only look back to give supplementary information to the details of my “awoken” being, like stories of trauma or places I met key characters; the stuff that really gets people going. For now I just sleep through these years of preface and in the passing moments in between, I daydream–for what is sleeping if not a reason to leave where you are–about the stories that will fill that book.
I think this all comes from my permanent urge to escape, eternally assuming the grass is greener on the other side and then clawing and weeping my way back when I realize I was wrong. I flee to places, either literally or into daydreams, hot with the fever of purpose. And eventually I get bored, and then feel trapped, and then choose something else.
“When everyone’s star is bright
 Brighter than you are
 It’s time to go
 And you’re the only one left
 Dancin’ while they’re on the floor
 Time to go”
 Paris, Texas – Lana Del Rey⁠04It might be a little too Tumblr-coded to post a Lana Del Rey bridge and call it the poetry that explains how I'm feeling, but that's who I am and I believe it to be true here.
The first time I was actually able to do this was leaving home to come here to MIT. And while I’m glad I don’t go to school near my hometown, I feel a certain air of regret. Not that I made the wrong decision, necessarily, but that I hyped it up too much only to become envious of the lifestyle I vehemently rejected, the peers I judged. It’s not so much that I want to do blackout Wednesday at some house party with people I barely knew or liked from high school, but at least those people know what they’re choosing. It feels more childish and regressive to act like moving to a city will change anything about it, like some annoying lead in a movie about someone moving to the Big City and all the Crazy Times and New Friends and Unexpected Challenges they have. But then why do I find hope so cringey if it’s what I’m asking for?
Next year, I’d guess nothing will change. But then again, I’ll turn 20, which is still not an adult but noticeably not a child. It has a different ring to it, all hard and consonant-y, sounding more aggressive and forward out of the mouth than the delicacy of sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. The images of both are so striking and specific. A twenty year old jumping in a dark club. A sixteen year old driving on the sunny coast. A twenty year old screaming and crying at their first true losses. A seventeen year old experiencing their first love. A twenty year old racing between the different paths of their lives. An eighteen year old dutifully reciting the plan for theirs every time someone asks.
Everything is better than when I was 16, though. But it’s not even as clear-cut as “everything is better, I’ve never felt worse”. It’s “everything is better, and I’ve never cared less about the fact that it’s going well”. Everything is better; I feel just the same. At best I’m cautiously optimistic and at worst anxiously moribund.
I feel at a crossroads between nothing, stuck between people and places and desires.
But isn’t this when all the interesting things happen?
this week, I got a tattoo of my mom and sister's birth flowers
note I did not get this out of crisis and did plan it out for months and have always wanted tattoos
I officially do not endorse getting tattoos during crises lol

"Cells, Cells, and more Cells",Jessica Z. '27,1 ,"December 3, 2025","Hello! It has been a really long time since I posted :’) My goal is to hopefully catch these blogs up to my current life, but instead of starting from the last time I blogged, I think I’ll start with where I am right now:
Right now, I’m in my junior year, and something I’ve been thinking about a lot is my major, Course 20: Biological Engineering. My classes before this semester were a mix of GIRs⁠01General Institute Requirements and Course 7⁠02Biology classes to get my pre-reqs completed, so I didn’t take my first Course 20-specific class until sophomore spring with 20.110⁠03Thermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems .
This semester, though, I’m taking:
7.06: Cell Biology
20.109: Laboratory Fundamentals in Biological Engineering
20.320: Analysis of Biomolecular and Cellular Systems
15.069: Applied Probability and Statistics
17.903: Political Science Internship and Research
7.06: Cell Biology
Something that felt has difficult for me at MIT before is that I’m not very interested in genetics or cells, which is a pretty big focus here. I’m more interested in biomaterials and tissue engineering, which definitely has pockets at MIT, but usually isn’t the focus of the Course 7 classes I’ve taken so far. Taking 7.06 this semester made me nervous because 1) I didn’t think I’d enjoy learning about cells and 2) the pre-reqs are 7.03 and 7.05⁠04Genetics and General Biochemistry , both of which I enjoyed as classes but struggled with.
So, I was pleasantly surprised that I like this class! The content is much more intuitive to me than 7.03 or 7.05, and it’s cool to really contextualize every biological function within the context of a super, super tiny cell. It’s also a pre-req for 7.23/20.230⁠05Immunology , 7.26⁠06Molecular Basis of Infectious Disease , and 7.371/20.371⁠07Biological and Engineering Principles Underlying Novel Biotherapeutics , which I’m hoping to take in the spring semester and my senior year.
20.109: Laboratory Fundamentals in Biological Engineering
I didn’t do research at all last year, since I spent my sophomore year in the depths of RingComm and the summer working in science policy in D.C. This class was my first lab class, and it’s split into two research project modules with wet-lab work. To be completely honest, the only wet-lab technique I completely remembered how to do was dilutions and pipetting, so I was a bit nervous at first. I really had to force myself the first few weeks to get over my fear of looking clueless in class, but it felt really, really nice to dip back into research. Our first project focused on quantifying DNA damage with two different biochemical assays, and the second project was focused on peptide engineering to capture heavy metal ions for quantum dot formation. Working in wet-lab again through this class was honestly a huge factor in me UROPing this year, which I’m not sure I would have done otherwise.
This class is also a CI-M! I really like science communication⁠08fun fact, Ceri (who helps run the MIT Admissions blogs and helps all the bloggers blog), works a lot in science communication, and I thought her work was really cool, which is part of why I wanted to apply to be a blogger :') (in the least stalker-ish way possible) , so it’s also been fun to learn more about scientific design and writing.
20.320: Analysis of Bimolecular and Cellular Systems
This class is, by far, my hardest. It’s a mix of differential equations, computational modeling, thermodynamics, and physics, all of which are not my strong suit. It focuses on modeling different biological systems, like receptor trafficking, bioreactors, and gene expression. I have a love-hate relationship with this class–I’ve battled A LOT with code in this class, but I think the teaching staff and TAs are really, really good, so it feels extra rewarding when I’m actually able to solve a PSET problem.
It’s (kinda) funny that I’ve technically been Course 20 the earliest I could have been, since I applied to MIT as a Course 20, but this is the first semester where I’ve really felt like a student in my major. My classes have pulled together all the scattered pieces of my pre-reqs from biology, chemistry, and math into something that feels more like biological engineering.
I spent a lot of sophomore year being really frustrated in classes because I wasn’t enjoying them as much as I had hoped or thought I should have. That made it difficult to feel like I was pursuing a major that I ultimately wanted, so it’s really exciting to be excited about classes again after a really, really long slump. I have a lottttt of thoughts about courses, classes, and post-grad plans, but for right now, I’m happy to feel more like I’ve found my place a little bit more as a student.",[]
Urban Studies and Planning at MIT!,Victor D. '27,0,"December 3, 2025","Student Profiles from the Department of Urban Studies and Planning
Urban Studies and Planning (Course 11) is a small, interdisciplinary major engaged in real-world issues. Since the posting of the last blog featuring DUSP⁠01Department of Urban Studies and Planning student profiles, the department introduced Course 11-6 otherwise known as Urban Science and Planning with Computer Science, which prepares students to use computational tools to make positive social impacts. If you’re curious to learn more, I asked some of my classmates to share what brought them to DUSP!

When I started at MIT, I came in as an 18-C.⁠02Mathematics and Computer Science I had always liked the idea of combining computer science with ✨ something else ✨ to solve problems, but it has always been very… abstract. After bouncing around for a while, I’m now a double in 6-3⁠03Computer Science and Engineering and 11,⁠04Urban Studies and Planning hoping to bring a data-driven skillset to solve the complex problems that’s inherent in planning.
In particular, my main interest is in transportation, particularly in the complex networks and systems that underly our built infrastructure. This means I end up taking a lot of classes with Course 1 (CEE),⁠05civil and environmental engineering and will be writing my UG thesis on computational urban bus network redesigns (but have done work in nature-based solutions, work zone data exchange, modelling specifications, and more). To me, DUSP encompasses so many different fields that all intersect, from housing to real estate to law to transportation, so seeing how these problems are all interconnected has been really fun for me over the years :)

Like many, I found my way to DUSP on the later side. While I’d considered Course 11 earlier in my MIT career, I spent my first two years in the world of Course 3 (Materials Science and Engineering) before switching to Course 11 as my primary major this past fall. I’ve always been interested in the intersections between technology and social issues, especially in relation to sustainability. I chose Materials Science because I wanted a strong scientific foundation for understanding novel climate technologies. However, I consistently felt drawn to the question of how these technologies are implemented in real social and political contexts. I realized I wanted to learn to think like a planner. In the same way Course 3 reveals the underlying principles behind materials, Course 11 reveals the underlying principles that shape our social systems–and how to design them to be more efficient, equitable, and sustainable.
Joining DUSP has expanded my world and exposed me to a thousand more questions than the ones I came in looking for answers to. My professors and classmates have introduced me to the connections between my interests and many other aspects of planning including geospatial tools, economic theory, data analysis for the public good, housing policy, and community development. I believe there’s no better place than MIT DUSP if you want to figure out how to make the world work better. There is a path for every set of skills and interests and you’ll be surrounded by an inspiring group of people deeply committed to serving and improving communities of all kinds.

In high school, computer science felt like a guiding torch while urban planning was a background presence. Researching historical artifacts and cartography as a library volunteer after hackathon practice was part of my weekly routine. Starting at MIT, I knew course 11-6 (Urban Planning with Computer Science) was a conceptually perfect major for me. Yet after hearing my desired study, I regularly got a confused look with the question, “How does that connect?” After immersing myself in classes like 11.188 Introduction to Spatial Analysis and GIS⁠06Geographic Information Systems and 11.540 Urban Transportation Planning and Policy, I believe my passion in these fields are infused with each other. A sophomore UROP⁠07Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program opportunity let me explore how bike infrastructure and safety could be estimated with data analysis and community perspective.
What excites me about urban planning is its necessity to balance technical knowledge and social understanding to bring forth productive development. DUSP consistently embeds this trivial principle with its professional support, ample research opportunities and inviting faculty. As I plan to specialize in transit-oriented development, I’m rest assured DUSP has space for my mixed interests to thrive and cultivate for my career.
 
Kahlen Wheaton ’27, Urban Studies and Planning
I came to MIT planning to major in Civil and Environmental Engineering.  However, as I began to meet new people and attend events Freshman Year, I found myself continually drawn to DUSP.  At the same time I was realizing that I didn’t like math or physics as much as I had thought.  This all culminated in my declaration of Course 11⁠08Urban Studies and Planning at the end of my Freshman year.
As a Junior, I could not be more happy with my decision. I am taking compelling and interesting classes and doing work that I find really meaningful.  As I have journeyed through DUSP, I have considered many different focuses.  I bounced between transportation and energy a few times before settling on housing and working on a housing-related internship this summer.  Although I liked it, it wasn’t quite right for me.  I realized that this indecision was an interest in all of these fields.
Since then I have discovered that the planning field of public health encompasses all these topics, from air pollution to urban farming, to housing and transit access.  Taking a public health class this fall and having become very involved in an environmental justice and farming club new to MIT this semester, I think I have found my place both at MIT, and within DUSP.","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/signal-2025-10-29-163123_003-800x600.jpeg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/signal-2025-10-29-163123_002-800x1066.jpeg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ファイル_000-800x1066.png', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_8840-800x450.jpg']"

39 windows and 2 friends,Boheng C. '28,7 ,"December 2, 2025","last year, i lived in simmons hall. simmons is known for many things at MIT — its rubber ducks, its chalk, its residents’ chronically online doomscrolling — but first and foremost among them, its architecture:
 
many of MIT’s buildings have their own quirks and eccentricities. none of them, with the possible exception of stata, can rival simmons. whether you think simmons is a masterpiece of postmodernism or an aesthetic atrocity, whether it’s tastefully provocative or just an eyesore, simmons has become unequivocally one of the most recognizable buildings on campus.
 
there’s a lot to unpack in this building, so let’s start with the windows. simmons has 5538 of them — five thousand five hundred thirty eight individual panes of glass — arranged in a meticulous rectangular grid. each floor has a height of three windows, so when you look at the building from afar, you might be tempted to think that there’s a forty-story behemoth towering over vassar street. contrary to appearances, simmons has just ten floors.
 
my room last year, which i shared with my two roommates, had 39 windows — three rows of thirteen windows each. even by simmons standards, this is a prodigious number. we only had so many windows because we lived in a large triple room at the very corner of the building; most double rooms have only around 20 windows.
what is it like to live with thirty-nine windows? well, you get used to it. and then you start taking things for granted. you take it for granted, for example, that your room gets inundated with bountiful voluminous sunlight cascading in from every direction with every sunset, even during the winter. you take it for granted that you need a makeshift coordinate system to refer to each window (“the fifth bottom window from the left wall”); you take it for granted that you forget which window had the broken hinge or the missing curtain. you take it for granted that there are windows behind every desk and cabinet and bed. you take it for granted that you have dozens of options to choose from when you look out over briggs field or dorm row or the charles river. you take things for granted until the day on which you move out and return home and stare wistfully out your single bedroom window, wondering what you lost.
of course, windows are not the only whimsical part of simmons. less obvious from the outside are all the curved concrete walls on the inside. sadly, our room didn’t have any, but most of the lounges in simmons have curved walls, as do the hallways and rooms adjacent to the lounges:
in the room that my friends cyan and liong share. if you want to learn more about the drawings on the wall, you should come here and take 8.03 (waves and oscillations), 8.04 (quantum physics i), 8.044 (statistical mechanics i), 18.06 (linear algebra), and 24.900 (introduction to linguistics)!
and you can draw on the concrete walls (curved or non-curved) to your heart’s content! even though housing and residential services has been clamping down on student artwork in recent years, the chalk drawings of simmons seem to have survived mostly unscathed.
the curved walls are everything a wall should be and shouldn’t be at the same time. they add depth and frivolity and they make furniture difficult to align; they contrast with the rigid window grid that governs simmons’s exterior. they make rooms have all sorts of deeply accursed shapes that undermine your basic conception of what a room should look like:
floor plan of room 729. the curved space labeled OTB is a lounge on the other side of the wall. no, i don’t know if you can fit a bed in the right half of the room; no, i don’t know how people live in this room. (if you live/have lived here, please please please tell me in the comments!!)
and then, of course, there are all the colors. simmons’s window frames are colored red, green, blue, and yellow on the outside. but these same colors also pervade the dorm interior, adorning the walls of suites and alcoves in the hallways. the rooms themselves lack color, and the walls are mostly gray concrete, feebly illuminated by a few lights that point towards the ceiling. simmons rooms are very dark. haters say that the stark aesthetics give prison vibes; i think that the darkness juxtaposes nicely with the bright hallway colors and the window illumination.
simmons is often affectionately referred to as the sponge, both because of its windows and its other forms of porosity. the aforementioned lounges carve out cavernous multi-story spaces, which let conversations resonate and sunlight filter through. every floor except for the second, fifth, and sixth floors are discontinuous in some way; that is, the building has gaps separating the hallway into multiple pieces. the third and fourth floors, for instance, are partitioned in two by a vast hole that stretches the width of multiple rooms. on the top three floors, the three towers (called a, b, and c) split off from each other and the hallways are no longer contiguous.
cross-sectional sketch of simmons during the planning phase (from steven holl architects); slanted vertical gray sections are lounges/common spaces
the design of the hallways — some stretching the entire length of the building, others truncated by gaps — create social dynamics that are hard to find in other dorms. the longer hallways are cosmopolitan and connect dozens of people; residents often have access to multiple lounges, common spaces, or laundry rooms⁠01simmons’s laundry rooms are spread throughout the building; each has just two washing machines and two dryers on their own floor. on the other extreme, my own floor (the a tower section of the tenth floor) has just a handful of rooms and no common spaces whatsoever. it’s very cozy and self-contained though, and it lacks the liminal horror of a hundred-meter hallway stretching into the far distance. you could get to know everyone on the floor if you wanted to!
hallway of medium length
located in the space between these towers, on the seventh and eighth floors, are small terraces with a smattering of benches and tables. you can go up there and talk with friends or lie down and stare at the sky. it’s intoxicating to be so high above the street and the trees and all the people walking past underneath, to feel the cold rarefied exhilarating wind.

of course, simmons’s divergent sense of whimsy also brought challenges. the large number of windows meant that our room struggled to retain heat during the winter; the panes of glass offered little insulation. our two heaters were dramatically inadequate, since they had no fans or active circulation but merely conducted heat into the room.
and then there was the window, located behind a cabinet connected to a bunk bed, that we opened when we first moved into the room. it made the room less stuffy during the sweltering august afternoons; in november, it became a nightmare. it began to let in drafts of freezing air, so we had to move the entire bunk bed and all the furniture around it just to shut this obstinate last window.
being a resident of a tower, simmons’s maze-like layout meant that our elevator didn’t even have a direct connection to the main entrance. on the first floor, it led to the kitchen and rear exit, which were separated from the entrance by the dining hall. we had to traverse the entire length of our building and take two different elevators, or a flight of stairs followed by an elevator, just to get to our room.
but you would be wrong if you thought that i despise simmons for its architectural irregularities. to the contrary, i love it for all its whimsy and quirks and manifold flaws. when i’m struggling on a pset problem or an essay late at night, when i’m stressed for a midterm, when i’m on the verge of breakdown or just plain tired, i try to look around myself. i realize again that i live in a building with twisted curvy walls and broken hallways and five thousand windows, and everything becomes fine again, all because of this accursed clownhouse of a dorm.","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2361-scaled-e1764670136122.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0281-scaled-e1764670121423.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2681-scaled-e1764669953386.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2802-scaled-e1764670105638.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7824-scaled-e1764669987296.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/room-729-400x261.png', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_4875-scaled-e1764668922180.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/atriums_old-400x170.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7081-400x312.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_4924-1-1000x1341.jpg']"
A Trip to AfroTech,Richard O. '28,1 ,"November 30, 2025","About a month ago, I left campus to take a little trip to Houston for this year’s Afrotech conference with MIT’s NSBE ⁠01National Society of Black Engineers - An organization that works to support the professional development of people who identify with the black community chapter, and after meeting so many cool and amazing people and learning about all the different ways that people are using AI in today’s world, I figured I’d share my experience here on the blog! For reference, AfroTech is an annual conference for students, companies, and professionals in the US that took place from Monday, October 27th to Friday, October 31st this year, and aims to celebrate and cultivate black talent across many different tech-based and professional industries worldwide.
Day 1:
So the whole trip started off on the Tuesday of that week with everyone leaving for the airport at 6 AM. Honestly don’t think there was another time I had woken up that early this semester and also don’t think I had ever seen/heard the city quite as peaceful as it was that morning:

Once we made it to the airport, we then picked up our tickets for our flight as everyone arrived in their Ubers, which was a fairly short process. From there, we filed through TSA and then made our way to our gate. Once we settled, everyone split up to grab breakfast from the different restaurants in Logan Airport as we waited for our flight.
Nome ended up getting special treatment and got wheeled through the airport since he had a boot on for his foot
 
The flight was around 4 hours, and we touched down in the city a little before noon. After we picked up our bags, we all booked group Ubers to our hotel, which was a really nice hotel but also fairly far from the airport. I had also never been to Houston before this, and seeing those wide 8,000-lane highways in real life, folding every which way over each other for the first time as we were driving was actually a shock to me.
Once we got to the hotel we actually had to wait a bit into the afternoon to check our stuff in so me and a group of others made a lunch trip to Chick-fil-A and then a quick Walmart run before calling it a day.
 
Day 2:
Next day started with my roommate and me getting up around 8 to head off to the convention center, but actually getting out of that large comfy hotel bed after months on my TwinXL dorm bed in the morning was a battle of its own😔. Eventually, we made it down to the lobby, where we met other NSBE members and booked our Ubers to the conference.
Christine was very locked in

At long last, we finally arrived for the first of two days at the convention and were met with lots of lively energy and some huge AfroTech signs outside that were impossible not to take a picture with.
Me and my roommate!
From there, we headed to registration where we received our lanyards and wristbands to attend the different events, and kicked the day off by entering the huge career fair taking place on the first floor.
Probably one of the coolest event entrances I have ever seen
I should’ve grabbed more photos inside but there were tons of companies out explaining the different work that they do and the opportunities they offer, and I probably spent 80% of that entire day talking to different professionals and learning about all the different ways that they were using AI and machine learning in their businesses.
After my social battery was drained, I grabbed lunch with a friend at one of the many food trucks lined up right outside the conference center and it was at this point that I started to realize that Houston had an obsession with briskets and mac and cheese… One of the other people attending suggested we try this one food truck that turned their briskets and mac into a wrap and while it did end up being really good, it was the first in a long list of brisket-based food items that I would be having that week…
After eating, I then went back inside to go listen to some talks that were happening on the upper floors of the convention center. It was honestly hard to decide which talk to go to because there were always multiple happening at the same time that ranged from design talks, to AI talks, to startup talks, to finance talks, and I lowkey wanted to go to all of them…
I ended up trying to get exposure to a mix of different topics and started off with a talk that discussed the startup funding and investing process for people who want to be founders.
 
 
 
I then followed that one up with a panel discussion by Capital One that reviewed the future role of AI in the workplace.
 
And then finally, I wrapped the day up with a design talk from Apple on designing user interfaces that support accessibility.
 
From there, I found a few people who were pretty much done for the day and Ubered back to the hotel in the evening to finish up an assignment for a class I had that day.
Day 3:
Similarly to the day before, I started the third day of this trip fighting a war to get out of the hotel bed, but eventually got to the conference center fairly early and started the day off with a well anticipated talk in the largest ballroom room from the CEO of Microsoft AI where he talked about his experience with the company and where he and Microsoft believe AI is moving in the future. It was honestly one of my favorite events because it really opened my eyes to the opportunity that AI and ML have in the near future, and drew me to want to research the concepts even further.
After that, I began another round of talking to companies about AI/ML that I didn’t get to the day before. After a couple of hours of meeting some really amazing people in the AI development space, I finished off the career fair by making a circle through the different booths for free merch. I then got a text from my roommate who wanted to visit this one restaurant called Leeland House that was near the conference center for brunch. It was quite the walk but absolutely worth the trip. We both ordered this hot honey chicken biscuit plate, and goodness gracious was it delicious.

After absolutely crushing that plate, we walked back to the conference center and I decided to finish the day by attending a Google panel and then watching an interview with NBA player John Wall on his journey through life that was beautifully put together. I then ubered back to the hotel that afternoon when it hit me that I was actually in Houston now and could finally try a sandwich from the Houston Hot Chicken chain that I kept getting ridiculous ads for on Instagram despite being like 800 miles away in Boston. Ended up not being that bad though.
Now I can say I’ve tried hhc
Later in the night, we all decided to finish off the trip with a group dinner at this barbecue restaurant called J bar M. Unsurprisingly, everyone mostly got briskets and mac again, but I will say it was probably the best brisket and mac I had that week.
After the dinner, we returned to the hotel where my roommate and I started packing up for our upcoming morning flight.

Day 4:
The next day was our last and started early with the flight back for my group taking off 8 AM. So we all met in the lobby around 6 AM and took our last Uber back to the airport with enough brisket in our stomachs to probably carry us through the whole day.
Roommate had some lobby dance lessons before heading out.

So like before, we picked up our tickets, made our way through TSA, and then waited by the gate to board our flight before finally returning to campus just in time for Halloween.

In the end, I truly had a great experience attending the conference for the first time, and I ended up making great connections with so many amazing students and professionals from all over the country. Having heard so many new things about the tools and opportunities out there, I’ve become a lot more excited to research artificial intelligence and machine learning tools and the potential they have for the future. Absolutely can’t wait to come back in future years to learn more!","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2683-1000x563.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2765-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2763-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/41126b9e-cf27-4578-b9fc-81abfffbc9f9_IMG_3102.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/5f838a25-0880-45be-913a-d948b5c158a5_IMG_2818-scaled.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2743-scaled.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2745-scaled-e1764546045839.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4d81285e-0d3b-4fff-9a35-71d4bbb189a7_IMG_2753-scaled-e1764546076930.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2805-1400x1050.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2807-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2806-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2828-scaled-e1764546403686-1400x1326.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2831-scaled.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2839-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/View-recent-photos-800x1261.png', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0a4547e135cd3237750577775219d80e.jpeg']"
How I Made the MIT Orientation Trading Card Game,Kayode D. '27,4 ,"November 30, 2025","The year is 2021. It’s a Sunday night in early January. My mother comes into my room. My floor is strewn with cardboard, canvases, markers and felt, boxes and tiny army soldiers. I’m sitting at my desk which is covered in cardstock and stacks of cards. I am furiously scribbling on a 2.5”x3.5” pieces of paper. I am putting the finishing touches on my Magnum Opus: Tommy’s Backyard: the board game. 
The first iteration of ""Relic"", a randomly generating dungeon crawler I made in high school.
A photo of my camera roll from the first set for ""Tommy's Backyard: the board game"". This was a game I made for Tommy's birthday and featured our friends and inside jokes from over the years.
The first game I ever made, Cornucopia. It was very similar to my mental image of Mario Party, a game that to this day I have never played.

Last year, I was an MIT Orientation Leader. This meant that I helped prepare campus to welcome the ~1,100 incoming students. It was a blast, and so this year, I applied to be an Orientation Captain! I got the position⁠01captain of the white team 🤪' , along with new blogger Caleb M. ‘27⁠02captain of the orange team 🙄' . 
On top of this, I was a part of the Flag Color Competition Committee. This was a group of captains that organized the games and fun events during Orientation to encourage student attendance. The incoming class of twelve-hundred is split up into twelve teams of a hundred-ish students each, and the top team at the end of the week gets a secret prize….….red on top. .
Going into the planning meetings over the summer, I was super excited to showcase the ideas I had. I LOVE board games and games in general, and I love MIT, so this is the perfect opportunity to make a massive, campus-wide game. I took some time to prepare the following presentation to present to my fellow captains on the committee with game ideas:
imagine me presenting this through a zoom call
Self explanatory game idea pitch: Minute-to-Win-It games that the students play instead of staff. Logistically a bit tricky but worth trying. 
I also really wanted to play kickball. I love kickball. I thought this would help keep atheletes attending events if they knew we would be playing Kickball afterwards. We ended up having it at a weird time and it was fun, but not super popular. 
Reminder, the goal is to make an easily accessible game that a lot of people can play, and puts the power to win the Red Sox tickets into the hands of students.
BOOM 💥💥💥
At the beginning of the week, every student is given a pack of MIT Trading cards with [twelve, i go the number wrong here] identical cards matching their team's color.
To complete their set, they must go find students on other teams that they may not have otherwise spoken to, and start a conversation to trade cards. This encourages social interaction outside of orientation small groups.
Where will the art come from? I wanted to have art be made by students, and I even pitched the idea to Margaret Zhang, creator of the illustrious Wide Tim, and she loved the idea!
Thank you for coming ot my TedTalk.

And thus, the MIT Orientation Trading Card Game was born! I had a LOT of ideas for how the game could go. I’ve dreamed for years of making real board games that people would actually want to play, and this was my chance to make a game on the scale of hundreds of concurrent players. But what do I need to consider when making this game? In my research over the years, I’ve found three key components to any good game. You need not excel in all areas, but you must adequately balance or excel in at least one to be “successful”. 
Mechanics: How strategically deep is your game?
Theme: What story is the game telling? What imagery does gameplay evoke?
Aesthetics: Is the game fun to look at? or does it look like it was made by a high schooler out of cardboard and scotch tape?

Looking through these three lenses helps you see what works well/doesn’t for games like Chess⁠03Very deep strategically, creates a story both within the game and surrounding your understanding of the opponent, and visually has a lot of room for creative expression. Solid game., Pokemon Cards⁠04The actual card game does have mechanical depth, but the imagery and world built around the cards is so rich that most people don't even play the game. Aesthetically, this game does so well that individual cards can sell for thousands of dollars. A Grade-A example of thematic worldbuilding and visuals in a game.', Exploding Kittens⁠05While not at strategically deep as chess or other card games, exploding kittens excels at it's ease of entry. The game can be fully explained in a few sentences and even children can play the game with full strategies. Thematically, the image of an exploding kitten is much stronger than a bomb, and this paired with the cartoon graphic aesthetic creates a game that captures both children and adults in the fun. Good game., and the accursed Candy Land⁠06CANDY LAND IS NOT A GAME. There is absolutely no strategy involved. You just draw cards and move around. A fish flipping around on a table could play the game with the same strategic brilliance as Magnus Carlsen. You just pick up cards and move that many spaces. That is not a game. The only thing it has going for it is it's candy theming and pleasing visuals. It's simplicity makes it popular among very, very small children, but it poses no significance as a real game beyond that. At least in my opinion. The world it build up is nice, though. .
So when making this game, I wanted to think carefully about what I was doing: The goal of the game is to foster communication and conversation. If the cards look bad, they wont be valuable [no one really REALLY wants to collect just tiny pieces of paper for no reason.] There also has to be potential for this to be a GAME. 
Do I create a game to play with the cards like with Pokemon Cards? Or what about having variety in the cards randomly inserted into packs? Would that make the game more fun or add disparity between players who start wit better/worse cards? Additionally, how am I going to acquire all of these cards? For each students to have a twelve-card pack, plus extras for OLs and staff, we’d need 16,200 cut cards. I wanted to find a company to outsource this to and seek fundraising from somewhere at MIT, but time was running out. A lot of things to consider, a lot of ideas to toss around…
Ultimately, the Office of the First Year staff told me to take it a step back for this year, and do what we can with what we have, but not to go overboard getting third-party printers or anything like that for right now. Maybe next year 😞 BUT STILL SO EXCITING. 
Card Designs:
Here are the card designs! They were made by a member of the OFY team for the candlyand [bombastic side-eye] themed orientation. I was able to reuse them for the card designs!
Here is the back art for the cards, made by fellow blogger Gloria Z. '26. The GOAT. // Part of the original idea was that to be counted, cards had to have the original owner's name on the back, to connect back the ownership of each card. I ended up scrapping this idea in the end, and it serves as a point of confusion for the game. 
For packaging, I took inspiration from this pack of trading cards I got at a Future Teens concert freshman year. 
Such a phenomenal band. Such a great concert. Such an amazing memento. Absolute Blog. 
Different pack ideas I threw around. 
My friend packing some of the cards in the end! very time consuming process. I see why Future Teens only had a handful for sale, and not *checks notes* 1350 of them...

TO CAMPUS I GO
In Late August, I flew back to MIT. I wrote a blog about the airplane and getting airplane trading cards, then began having meetings and trainings to prep for MIT Orientation 2025. We sent the card print order to the MIT Copytech department, and a few days later all 16,200 were printed, cut, and in a box in the OFY.
Now, I just had to package them. Oh right. 
Friends who came to help pack up the cards! Many thanks friends🙏🙏
All of the cards packed. Initially I wanted to use paper to make little packs for that satisfying rip feeling, but that was taking wayyyy too long. In the end we had someone go get rubber bands to tie them together instead. Much MUCH faster.

Luckily, I was able to recruit a group of my friends and we packaged all 1350 packages of cards in under three hours [ahh!]. Thank you phenomenal friends 👏👏👏. 
All that was left was to announce the game to the freshman…
I was sweating soooo hard backstage. I was going to announce and present my game. To the entire class of 2029. When they call my name to go onstage. Also Sally Kornbluth was there. But more importantly, I was sweating nervously like crazy. High school me would die if he knew what I was doing right now, where I was, and what I was about to announce. 
In the end, the game had a generally positive reception from the crowd. I didn’t want to overload information, so I left some info out [which would turn out to be a very important mistake later]. 
They open their cards
After the presentation, the students went out to Kresge field and opened up their packs of cards, and…. 
They loved it!!!
Everywhere I looked, I saw students searching for cards to complete their set, and it felt like I had actually made something. I had actually made a card game. And it was being played. Caleb came running up to me at one point and shouted “KAYODE THEY LOVE IT. WE CANT GET THEM TO STOP” and it felt so accomplishing. Maybe I’ll drop out and start developing games.
IMG_4165<— For whatever reason it’s not letting me embed the video. This downloads the video, feel free to do this…or not. haha
I watched students wander around Kresge Oval, asking other students to trade cards and starting conversations! And it wasn’t just the introverted, game-loving nerds who were trading cards [like I expected], but I also saw athletes and the future frat/sorority people getting into it, too! People were so into the game that we had to shout for them to stop playing and go back inside for the next presentation. The OFY staff approached me during all of the chaos to tell me it was an amazing idea and we will definitely do it again next year. 
I did notice some clear improvements that could be made to the game. For one, there was no reason to have a conversation with anyone. It was faster to just trade and walk away, so many students didn’t end up really talking to a ton of people if their main goal was to complete their set. Additionally, the game was short! Some students speedran the game and finished in five minutes, and when they asked me what to do next, I had to tell them that they won [ 🥳 ] and now the game is over. There was no reason to interact through the game beyond the first fifteen minutes. All things to consider when improving the game for next year…
Epilogue:
There was another board game that debuted during orientation, called Analogia. I’ll explain more about this game in a later blog, but what matters for this story is the creator, Cassie L. Cassie works in the MIT Media Lab at the Centre for Constructive Communication, and Caleb M. ‘27 was kind enough to introduce us after I debuted my game. I told Cassie about my game and heard more about the work she’s done designing social games similar to mine. We talked about board game design, and from talking about making and playing different types of games, I realized how much she knows and how much I could learn from her. She knows so much more than me, and I desperately wanted to hear more about the things she’s working on. 
Luck for me, at the end of our conversation, she asked me if I wanted to keep working on this game. She then offered me a UROP to work under her on social game design at the MIT Media Lab.
I WORK ON BOARD GAMES AT THE MIT MEDIA LAB
So now I have a job working in the MIT Media Lab in the Center for Constructive Communication, developing my game for next year’s orientation. WHAAAAATTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
IMAGINE if little high school Kayode could read that sentence way back when. Before I came to MIT I didn’t do many technology-related activities, and most of my time was spent making board games. I didn’t think that it was the kind of thing that MIT would look for in an applicant [I was surely mistaken], and even after I got in, I thought it was something I wouldn’t be able to keep doing with time commitments. 
BUT NOW. I WORK AT THE MIT MEDIA LAB. MAKING BOARD GAMES. 
I WORK THERE. In that building. And I make board games. God is Good.
Many blogs coming. Big blogs coming. Yippee.

I’m still reading applications,Jeremy W.,8 ,"November 28, 2025","5 years ago on November 28, 2020, it felt like my entire world was 15 steps wide. In the throes of the pandemic, I spent every day inside my cozy 600-square-foot one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge, measuring my days by the number of applications read during the Early Action cycle, and by how many cups of coffee I could consume until it was physiologically irresponsible. That year we were met with a historic number of applications…and I had nothing but time to read them.
Scarce hours of daylight were punctuated by Zoom calls and Slack huddles with colleagues, digitized attempts at recreating our chaotic in-person lunchroom banter. Daylight would fade around 4 PM (perhaps the worst aspect of living at the far edge of the Eastern time zone), and I would eventually wander a few steps into the kitchen to take a break. Was it a late lunch? An early dinner? I shouldn’t make another coffee, should I? I usually would.
I’m not sure I saw it as clearly then, but reading applications during quarantine was something of a blessing. It offered the opportunity to escape the monotony of my own life by living vicariously through the stories of others.
Today, my world is bigger. I live in a different apartment now (still in Cambridge) but with twice the space. Choosing to move here was likely a reaction to the pandemic; ironically, despite now having more space, I rarely work from home. Even on reading days, I usually opt to leave and head to campus to work instead. On the rare days that I do stay back, like today, I appreciate the quintessentially Cambridge view from my living room window.
But regardless of where I am sitting, the practice of reading applications remains a familiar habit, largely unchanged by the setting. Each fall, as the November 1 deadline approaches, I slip back into my strange monastic ritual. I activate Reading Mode, enter an industrious fugue state, and emerge weeks later with all my files read. Every admissions officer has their own system, a personal set of idiosyncrasies that govern how we approach the bizarre, intimate task of spending all our waking hours learning about the lives of others. I’m hardly as efficient as I ought to be; it feels almost sacrilegious to prioritize productivity when peering into the lives of others, gaining proximity to their aspirations, and making sense of their stories.
Such a task is both an immense honor and a weighty responsibility. While my routine feels well-worn at this point, the job never seems to get easier. After closing my laptop, I often need time to decompress before I can do anything else. Maybe that’s why I choose to go into the office—my 15-minute walk through Cambridge serves as the perfect salve, a requisite transition between your worlds and mine.
Perhaps the thing I resent most about reading season is how it robs me of the ability to read for pleasure. After spending all day consuming what is (mostly) non-fiction in applications, my eyes hardly allow me to indulge in a novel at night. This summer I finally finished In the Distance by Hernán Díaz, a novel I had attempted to read last year during application season. The book follows the journey of a young Swedish emigrant, Håkan, traveling across the harsh mid-1800s American West.
“A year and an instant are equivalent in a monotonous life,” Diaz writes of Håkan’s life.
In reading applications, it is my goal to understand the world an applicant comes from, how they shape their world, and how they are shaped by it. But I’ve come to see how I am shaped by these stories, too. If Díaz is right, then this season, despite its exhaustion, is my ritualistic resistance against time slipping away, my rejection of sameness.
These files, in their thousands, prevent my days from blurring together. So, while I wish I had the time and energy for more socializing friends, reading more novels, and getting more sleep, I gladly accept the trade. What a privilege it is to resist monotony thanks to all of you.",['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7946-1000x1333.jpeg']
HAPPY THANKSGIVING!! 🦃,Hala K. '29,2 ,"November 27, 2025","Whenever someone wishes me a Happy Thanksgiving, I can’t help but respond “Yara has a peath sign on her head!”
At around age 7, while playing games with my older sister, Yara, she pulled out her phone and started recording. Laughing, she begged, “Say it! Say it!” It was Thanksgiving Day, and she wanted a cute video to send to the family group chat. So, I put my fingers in a peace sign over her head and giggled declaring “HAPPY THANKSGIVING – Yara has a peath sign on her head!!!”
This video has become LEGEN… wait for it….DARY ⁠01can you tell I just finished 'How I Met Your Mother' in my family. Every year, without fail, I brace myself for the number of times I plan to hear it on Thanksgiving day – my family’s unofficial holiday greeting.
So, to officially kick off this blog: HAPPY THANKSGIVING! Yara has a peath sign on her head!

Thanksgiving is about expressing gratitude⁠02While expressing gratitude is a part of Thanksgiving, I want to make sure we don’t reduce it to only a cheerful holiday. Many of my international friends have recently asked, 'What is Thanksgiving, anyway?' And transparently, I realized that most times I didn't have a great response.
Sure, I could repeat what we all learned in elementary school - that the pilgrims (European colonists) and Native Americans shared a big feast to celebrate friendship and give thanks. But I couldn’t explain much beyond that, especially the parts of history that are much less celebratory.
So, whether you're an international student with little context or an American student who’s now realizing you may know less about the holiday than you thought - I recommend this quick read to deepen your understanding: https://blog.nativehope.org/what-does-thanksgiving-mean-to-native-americans.
If you know a better source, please share - I'd love to read it and pass it along!
(I mean, it’s right there in the name). So, I figured I’d use this post to give thanks.
I’m thankful for the opportunity to be home in Michigan for Thanksgiving.
I’ve recently been feeling very homesick (blog coming soon to a laptop near you) so just four days at home means more to me than I can properly articulate. It’s the tiny things – finding my decorated bedroom exactly how I left it, my mom yelling at me from downstairs to help set the table, hearing the sound of my siblings laughing in the kitchen.
And one of the tiny things that I’d argue may top the list: food.
I’ve had many friends over the years confidently declare that their mom is “the best cook.” Unfortunately, they’re all wrong. Because MY mom is the best cook. To the extent that I’ve been telling her for years that she should audition for MasterChef (as an avid watcher, I’m sure she would win).
Which leads me to the painful transition to dining hall food. ⁠03Though, I do want to highlight that the McCormick Dining Staff is truly amazing (and really all the dining halls but I'm most familiar with McCormick). They not only 1) make great food, but also 2) intentionally offer dishes from a variety of cultures to give everyone a little taste of home. I’ve tried dorm food at several other colleges, and I’d genuinely argue that ours is actually really good. I’m transparently just being a complainer - and a loyal fan of my mom’s cooking. For the first few weeks, college dining halls seem fine. You’ll even catch yourself saying “Honestly, that was pretty good!” But when it’s all you eat – every day – you slowly start to lose your sanity and begin daydreaming about literally any other food you’ve ever eaten in your life.
After a 4-hour flight delay (from a 5 AM flight to a 9 AM one), I’m finally home. Typing this from my very own bed which, at this moment, feels like the most luxurious place on Earth.
Thankful doesn’t even begin to cover it.
I’m thankful for my family.
Okay yes, I know this is pretty basic but I don’t think I could write this blog without saying it.
There are days when the Psets and exams pile up so high that I don’t find a minute to call home. And those always seem to be the worst days.
I hear stories from my mom about the ridiculous pranks her students ⁠04for context, she's a high school math teacher pulled on her. Complaining to my dad about exams and him always confidently replying “well, you are smart so I’m sure you don’t need to be stressed and will get a 100%.” ⁠05I won't, but I appreciate the confidence Hearing updates from my brother about his research, and then casually learning that he ran another marathon – leaving me in disbelief at how incredible he is (and in how we share the same DNA). My sister Sara for spending hours listening to all my rants and always giving the most sound advice. My other sister Yara for… wait I will do a separate paragraph for this.
My parents both immigrated from Lebanon and worked tirelessly their entire lives so that their children could have a fraction of the opportunities I do. Throughout high school, my mom woke up at the literal crack of dawn to drive me to early NHS meetings and spent weekends with me at robotics competitions. My dad somehow always knew when I’d had a rough day, showing up with a plate of fruit at my door – often spending hours cutting and de-seeding pomegranates, because he knows it’s my favorite.
I’m thankful for my sister Yara.
While homesickness has become a reality for me, one of the reasons I’ve been able to keep going is because of my sister, Yara. She is currently a student at Harvard Business School, which means she lives only about ten minutes away from MIT’s campus. Every Friday night, she calls and asks, “What are you doing tonight?” I quickly pack a pair of outfits in my backpack and make my way to her apartment. Sometimes we find a new restaurant to try; other times, we cook something together at the last minute.
I usually sleep over, and while I attempt to pay off my bajillion hours of sleep debt, she wakes up early and makes a tasty, Lebanese breakfast. We spend the rest of the day studying, talking, and doomscrolling for hours.
In a new environment where everything feels (and is) foreign, it’s nice to have someone who knows my character and humor.
I’m thankful for a lot. My friends, both old and new. The fact that I get to attend a school that, just a year ago, lived entirely in my dreams. TV shows because picture-in-picture mode is the only way I survive my 8.01 (Physics) Psets. And most of all, I’m thankful that I have this much to be thankful for in the first place.
If you’re reading this, I encourage you to think of just one thing you’re thankful for. It can be something as niche as the New York Times games (officially adding this to my list) or something very general like your health, waking up in the morning, ANYTHING. I think it’s important to pause and recognize the good, especially when the challenging parts of life tend to take up more space in our thoughts than they deserve.
Oh, and thank you if you’re still reading. It means a lot to know that someone – potentially across the world – is interested in these small fragments of my life. I’ve always loved storytelling, and writing these blogs has become a meaningful outlet for me to share the stories I’ve always wanted to tell but never had the space for before.
To everyone, Happy Thanksgiving – Yara has a peath sign on her head!",[]
"everything i think i’m not (rush, part 2)",Caleb M. '27,2 ,"November 25, 2025","In the many days prior to Kresge Kickoff, I kept saying it, kept thinking it. 
Passing conversations during Orientation training—What are you looking forward to this year? I’m gonna rush, because I’m everything I think I’m not. Do you know anything about Greek Life? Not much, but I will soon, because I’m everything I think I’m not. Hey, what are you up to on Saturday? I’ll be busy being everything I think I’m not, at Rush. 
I think I kept repeating it to myself in the hopes that if I said it enough times, told enough people about it, then maybe, just maybe, it would finally become true.
 
Day 1: The Kickoff
If you’re unfamiliar with how frats operate at MIT, they are all collected under the umbrella of the Interfraternity Council, or IFC, which acts as their collective government for the various internal and inter-community affairs involving MIT’s 25 fraternities. To begin the week of rush, IFC hosts the annual Kresge Kickoff in which each frat sets up a table under the tent on Kresge that’s used for Orientation affairs such as Convocation, and all the (mostly) frosh guys go around to the different tables and talk to the brothers of different frats and get these little cards that have all the different events that each frat is hosting on them. Thus, I reasoned, there was no more authentic way to start my rush experience than at Kresge Kickoff.
Stop one on kickoff day was, of course, the entrance to the Kresge Tent. Set up at the entrance were a few tables, hosting two things: 1) pizza, and 2) the 2025 Rush shirts. Every year, for Kresge Kickoff, IFC designs a shirt that says “[YEAR] IFC Rush” and has some design that includes all of the different frat letters somewhere on the back. As I was walking up to the tent on Kresge that Saturday afternoon, I remember looking quite closely at these shirts on the table at the entrance. They were baby blue, with “MIT IFC 2025 KRESGE KICKOFF” on the front and an illustration of the Student Center and a pedestrian crossing sign covered with a bunch of stickers, each displaying the letters of a different frat, on the back. I’d seen the Rush 2023 and 2024 shirts around, donned by my fellow ‘27s and some of my ‘28 friends, and always thought of them as a bit of a symbol more than anything, signifying that this MIT Man had gone through the Rush Process, had did the thing. 
But as I stared into the hypnotic pastel of this year’s tees, I got the overwhelming sense that this was a turning point. Once I picked up that shirt, it meant that I was committing—I was committing myself to this journey, to this change, to Rush, whatever it would bring. There was no going back, no returning the shirt, no returning the experience, once I decided if I wanted to get a medium or a large. I’d only ever seen those shirts on frat guys—and in getting one, I was telling the world that I was ready to become what I’d only ever thought of as “one of them.” It was a bit scary, a bit odd, and took some imagination to see myself wearing that shirt, both literally and metaphorically… but it was also strangely, thoroughly, exciting, visualizing myself as everything I thought I was not. And with that image in mind, I steeled myself, grabbed my IFC 2025 Rush T-Shirt, and took my first step into Kresge Kickoff.
Under the tent, I found myself in the center of MIT’s controlled chaos, with a few hundred guys milling about between the different parts of the crowd. Each of the 25 frats had their own table with their Greek letters emblazoned somewhere visible, staffed by a few brothers in shirts that betrayed their allegiances as members of one frat or another. Every now and then, the frats seemed to send out a few guys into the foray of frosh to find their future pledges, equipped with a handful of event cards and a phone number for quick access to the frat van/car/bus (? looking at you here, Skulls). It was loud, it was hectic, and it was just about what I expected of Kresge Kickoff.
I decided to navigate the tent clockwise, starting from the entrance and walking by each table, pausing for a moment if it caught my eye and chatting briefly with the brothers if I found myself so inspired. One thing that made this whole affair notably different for me than it was likely intended to be was, however, the fact that I was rushing as a Junior—I’d already formed a lot of pretty strong notions about the different frats from stories and friends and experiences, and I knew that I wouldn’t have the wide-eyed stupor of a first-year seeing Greek letters for the first time. Thus, I already had a kind of shortlist of frats I was looking at, mostly because I knew brothers already and had spent some time around each—Theta Chi, Nu Delta, Sigma Nu, maybe Zeta Psi—and, contrastingly, a shortlist of frats that I was particularly not looking at rushing, which I will not name here, perhaps in the interest of their reputations. Regardless of this, I tried to keep an open mind, and I stopped at a lot of tables to say hello to some of the brothers, talk to guys I knew, dap a few of them up,⁠01Dap is actually a practice rooted deeply in Black History, dating back to Black Soldiers fighting on behalf of the United States in the Vietnam War. Standing for 'Dignity and Pride,' it was used as a sign of solidarity between men who felt that they had been thrown away by their country. I recommend this quick read if you'd like to learn more. and grab an event card to check out what might be going on. Was it awkward? Sometimes, yeah. I felt a little bit out of place, and I got the feeling that some of the brothers noticed that I was a bit out of my element—this was definitely NOT my comfort zone. And as this awkwardness built, my sense of hesitance built along with it. Was this not right for me? Should I not be here? Can the guys around here tell that I’m not used to this?
I was particularly caught up in this train of thought about halfway through the tent when—“Caleb! Hey!” I turned at the sound of my name to see Kayle O. ‘26, waving from the Sigma Nu table. I walked over to her and we chatted a bit—she was a friend of the house, and she was helping staff for Kickoff. I told her about how I was feeling regarding Rush, being everything I think I’m not, and how Kickoff already had me feeling a bit strange about the whole process. In her infinite wisdom, Kayle told me very sincerely that she thought my reservations were holding me back from trying something new, encouraging me to continue rushing without paying mind to feeling like I would or wouldn’t fit into a space. She reminded me that the whole point was to explore something I hadn’t done before and told me that, against my own worries, she could totally see me as a brother of a frat and I shouldn’t let my own thoughts hold me back.
I can pretty sincerely say that this conversation saved my Rush experience from ending the moment I walked out of that tent. With a renewed sense of belonging, or at least a sense that I’d belong anywhere I wanted to, I thanked Kayle for the pep talk and kept walking to the remaining tables on the other side of the tent. 
After a few more slightly awkward conversations in which I felt like the most noticeable things about me were the way I talked, the fact that I was Black as a reason to be either overlooked or tokenized, or my Brass Rat signifying my not-frosh-ness, I slipped the several different frat cards into my back pocket and prepared to leave the tent when two guys approached me—which, interestingly, had not happened many times throughout Kickoff. “Hey there; how’s your kickoff been?” said one of them. “I’m Nathaniel. Nice to meet you.” We had a short conversation, and I noticed that it was very… normal. I was not being smothered by frattiness, but I didn’t feel like these two guys were particularly removed from frattiness either. They just seemed like guys who wanted to talk to me. 
“We’re brothers of SAE. You should come check us out this week.” I hadn’t heard of them before, which was pretty surprising, but also intriguing in that maybe Rush wasn’t as squared away into predetermined lists as I had expected. Nathaniel handed me a card and (after the obligatory “Wait, are you Habesha?” that seems to happen when any two Ethiopians meet for the first time on campus) we said our goodbyes, bookending Kresge Kickoff for me as I walked back into the sunshine outside of the tent and pulled out my phone to shoot my friends a quick Voice Memo(“you won’t believe where I just got out of…”) as I walked back to Simmons to decompress and think briefly before chugging a Monster and launching into what makes Rush Rush: the events. 
Rush, really, boils down to a big game for everyone involved. For the rushers, it’s about finding what fits for you, which community meshes with your sense of self the best and is the most fun to be around over the course of the week as well as convincing the people already in that community that you’re worth accepting as their newest Pledge. For the frats, on the other hand, it’s a competition for who can put on the best show. Which frat is the coolest? Which does it the biggest, blows the most money, has the most fun? I’m pretty confident that everybody knows that the paintballing, jet-skiing, steak-and-lobstering, and so forth is not actually the experience of being a brother of a frat, but all of us suspend reality for the week and immerse in the illusion—and the fun!—of it all. People go to as many events as they can, rushing or not rushing, to get free food and enjoy the actually really fun events that the frats pub on the little cards you find littered all around campus in that week before the semester starts. A handful of these events are recurring and become sort of a tradition for the frats, a few of those become pretty well-known throughout campus, and one stands out as probably the most iconic event of MIT Rush and was the first event I found myself at—ZP Car Bash.
Imagine, if you will, a car. Imagining one? Good. Now, take out all of the windows and mirrors, drain it of all fluids, and set it up in a parking lot with some cinder blocks by the tires to make sure it doesn’t move. This is the scene you’ll find at the beginning of Zeta Psi’s Car Bash. The event starts by handing a bunch of 17- to 20-year-olds a bucket of cans of spray paint and unleashing them on the car to graffiti every square centimeter of the exterior with anything their minds deem funny, interesting, or crazy enough to spray paint onto a car. Once the car is thoroughly… designed, let’s say… everybody but a group of about four rushers stands back. That group of rushers is handed safety goggles, gloves, and most importantly sledgehammers, and as a ZP brother sets a 5 (or something like that) minute timer, the guys run at the car, attacking it with all the energy they can muster and destroying anything they can get their hands on—hence, Car Bash. After this group finishes, the next one is up, and the cycle of destruction continues until either the car is sufficiently beat up or the event comes to an end. Anything you get off the car, you get to keep, so if you ever see spray-painted car doors around campus, those are the spoils of ZP’s Bash!
Car Bash was a hell of a good time. I’d always seen videos of the event and wondered what it would be like (also a bit of a theme throughout my entire Rush process) and, now, here I was! I was already a bit nervous about Rush at large, and I had some energy to get out after Orientation closed the day prior, and Car Bash was a great way to do just that. I beat the living crap out of that backdoor.
One moment in particular that stood out to me came as a group of guys was, after about an hour of different squadrons working on it, trying to get one of the doors off. As they were whacking away at the hinges, the rest of us looked on, and I remember one of the frosh going, “They’ve got to twist it!” to the rest of the group of watchers. He was right—they weren’t going to sledge through the last part of the connectors straight-on; they had to twist it around the hinge to get the door off. So, naturally, I yelled to the guys attacking the car, “TWIST IT!” 
Unexpectedly, in this moment, the frosh around me turned and seemed to shush me a bit, surprised that I would share our realization with the other guys. I was pretty taken aback by their somewhat hostile reaction, until I realized—they were first-years, and classes hadn’t started yet. To them, the other guys were their competition, and if they succeeded at getting the door off then anybody who didn’t have their hands on the door at that very moment had lost; the only victors were the ones who’d ripped it off the suburban. Comparatively, I didn’t see any of the other guys as my competition: everybody had beat that door off the car together, and it was the culmination of everyone’s effort that led to the ultimate success, regardless of who actually “got” the door in the end. The “collaborative, not competitive” thing was really shining, and I was the only one around who thought through that lens because I was the only one around who had actually been an MIT student already.
Nonetheless, Car Bash was great, and even though I didn’t get any pieces of the car as a souvenir, I walked back to my room carrying the sense that Rush had finally really begun. 
To close out the first day of my potential new life as a Frat Guy, I spent a few minutes at one of the many Rush Parties that were being thrown that night—a watered down, ultra-packed, exceedingly humid and sweaty version of the fabled MIT Frat Party. Because of how extremely packed it was at the house, my friend Elijah R. ‘27 and I went upstairs to sit in our friend’s room for a few minutes and get away from the intense haze and cloud of bodies partying for the first time. 
In this brief time sitting, I spent a lot of time thinking very carefully about where I wanted to actually rush. The frat that I was sitting in at the moment was, at least in my view, particularly “fratty,” and throughout the night I noticed various small things that put me off of the idea of participating fully in or committing myself entirely to that kind of space. I realized that there was some part of me that, regardless of how “everything I think I’m not” I was, didn’t want to be changed as a function of me being in a frat; I wanted, regardless of who I was or wasn’t, to be true to myself, to the values I held at the core of my being. I worried that, if I were to rush a really “fratty” brotherhood⁠02the only way i could avoid saying ""a fratty frat"" and immerse myself in that environment, I would have to put on a “mask” to fit into that way of being because it would not be natural for me. I wondered, at that moment, how long I would continue to wear that mask before it started to look like it was my real face.
And in that moment, looking in the mirror in my friend’s closet, faced with the choice between a mask for the sake of whatever I was rushing for or my truth for the sake of my sense of self, I knew that I wasn’t going to gun for the frattiest of MIT’s frats—I knew that I would choose my countenance.
 
Day 2: Something, Anything, Everything
I spent much of Sunday, honestly, not doing rush. After realizing that I wasn’t super into the frattiness of… well, of the frats, I was now kind of lost as to where exactly I wanted to end up with rushing. I didn’t feel super connected with a lot of the groups that I met at Kickoff, and my list of targets was already getting shorter. I didn’t really want to go to any events, and I felt weird texting brothers of random frats to pick me up in gigantic vans outside of Simmons, and I had some other stuff that I needed to handle that day, so I fielded the texts that I was getting sent from people I’d given my number to at Kickoff with a “I’ve got work at the radio station today, but thanks anyway!” and generally continued just thinking about, and not actually participating in, Rush in general. 
As I sat in the Walker Basement that afternoon, I remember feeling like I was coming to a bit of a dead-end; Rush definitely didn’t feel like it was over, but I also didn’t really know where to go from where I was at. I didn’t want to fling myself into spaces where I was uncomfortable, but at the same time I did—that was also sort of the whole bit. I didn’t want to betray my values or sense of self, but I also reasoned that if I was going to be everything I thought I was not then I had to somehow diverge from what I believed myself to be or what I believed myself to believe about myself. I wanted to try being more than I was, somehow different, but I also knew that so much of this entire experiment was about being accepted as I was. How was I supposed to make all of these contradictions mesh—more importantly, how was I going to get them to mesh in less than a week?
As I was thinking, I found myself scrolling mindlessly on Instagram to distract myself, and at one point I went to my DMs to see a message from a brother of one of the frats—Nathaniel, who I’d met at Kickoff the day prior. I remembered the brief conversation we’d had the day earlier, and remember how overwhelmingly normal the entire affair was. It was one of the few moments at Kickoff where I felt almost completely natural; more normal, even, than when I’d spoken to my friends at their own respective tables. Weirdly, I found that from our conversation, it appeared that his frat was able to bear a lot of those contradictions that I’d been facing: I didn’t feel uncomfortable in the conversation, but I was still stepping out of my normal activities by a very function of rushing. I felt like I was still being myself, but that I could be myself as a frat brother. I could grow, but I also felt like I could be accepted as I was at the moment. 
At first, I hesitated—I hadn’t heard of his frat before, and I’d already kind of swiped past his message beforehand. But in that moment, I realized that that was the perfect motivator: I had no preconceived notions of the community except that it didn’t seem overwhelmingly fratty, and I could go in with a fully open mind, which made this the perfect opportunity for my Rush experience to be as authentic as possible. Even as I went back to my work, something about it was poking at the back of my mind: give it a shot. You never know.
And as I parked my BlueBike and walked up to the purple-painted door of SAE, I took a deep breath, readied myself to start a slightly different Rush experience than I’d expected, and with some sense of a turning point somewhere soon, lifted my fist and knocked.
…which was met with no response. I knocked again, and it seemed quiet, so I reached for the door handle and peered briefly inside to find the house empty. Had I missed the event, and perhaps this shot at something new?
But, upon DMing Nathaniel back briefly and asking if I’d missed the event, I learned that they were actually just out back, which makes sense because the event was Surf and Turf and it is a bit difficult to man a grill inside a house. Nathaniel came from around the block and, after the expected pleasantries, walked with me back to the event!
After spending a bit more time with Nathaniel, I continued to make the rounds and met a handful of other brothers—Jonathan, Addison, Lance, and more—and recognized a few from my time at MIT, namely Eddy who had been my TA for 8.01 and Thomas, manning the grill, who had been my CPW child freshman year, along with a few familiar faces from walks up and down the Infinite. I had some shrimp (Surf) and steak (Turf) as well as a cup of Arizona Green Tea and chatted about different things with everyone; I told Addison about how believing that “Life is Short,” Lance about WMBR and my love for music, and Jonathan about being everything that I thought I wasn’t and why I was rushing as a Junior. The conversations were actually all quite nice, and the guys were the same—I remember Lance excitedly finding Tommy, founder of MIT Live, when I told him about how much I loved music; Addison came across genuinely invested in understanding my perspectives about life while also sharing his; and Jonathan seemed in staunch support of my adventure with rushing and trying out something new to get out of my comfort zone. It was a really good time, and at one point some of the guys started playing a bit of music on some guitars (if my memory serves) that I recognized as the intro to Frank Ocean’s Pink + White; so, naturally, I started to sing along. It was interesting—for whatever reason, even though I’d just met most of the guys around me within the hour, I felt comfortable enough to perform the vocals for this song in the spur of the moment. It was, honestly, a really good time.
After a brief tour of the house and stopping by some of the guys’ rooms, I went around and said some goodbyes to the guys I’d met that day. “Do you want a ride back? We should be taking the van back to campus soon,” one of them mentioned. “I’m all good—I’ll just bike back,” I replied; I wanted to bike myself back through the city. And as I put my AirPods in and blasted my biking playlist, I sped through Boston with a smile on my face. I had tried something new by taking myself to SAE that day, and as I flew past brownstones and over bridges, an exciting echo rang through my mind: the sound of the opening of a new, bright purple, door.
 
Days 3 and 4: The Rush Part
The next few days were the most quintessential to rush: more events! At this point in the week, everyone seemed to have settled into which frats they were mainly looking at and planning on rushing, and at the start of Day 3 I had settled into focusing on SAE and Sigma Nu.
I kicked off this next phase of Rush by sitting outside of Simmons, waiting for one of the vans. As mentioned, these vans are pretty… thought-provoking, one might say. They’re thoroughly decorated with various images and designs (evokes Car Bash somewhat, besides the extreme destruction) drawn in some sort of washable marker, and they’re often used as an on-demand shuttle service between campus and the frat houses for whatever event they might be hosting that afternoon. The shuttle I was waiting for, however, was not headed for Beacon Street and Frat Row. It was actually headed the opposite direction—far north, where with Sig Nu, I strapped on a helmet and filled up a magazine with pellets for a few rounds of Paintball and pizza in middle-of-nowhere Massachusetts. 
I remember myself being… okay at best? at Paintball. We did a huge war arena, (my team won and I didn’t get eliminated!) a smaller outpost-style enclosure (I totally got eliminated), and then finally went to war during Capture the Flag in the forest out back (which my team won again!). Quite notably, I remember not being chosen last (and actually being picked rather early) when the captains were choosing their teams, which definitely made me smile; the contrast between high school was salient, and I liked the feeling of being wanted in a space. That sense was a big part of Rush too—the wish to be not just accepted but wanted in a space. I knew that Rush involved a lot of selection, especially on the parts of the Frats to choose who they would continue rushing; thus, to be rushed by a frat was to be selected, to be wanted for the qualities that you possess. It was a feeling that I hate to admit I was pursuing, but it was also one that was actually being satisfied in the process of rush even before the week was through.
After Paintball, we returned to the Sig Nu house for some barbecue and chatting, and it was all a swell time—I chatted with some of the brothers that I knew, hung out with some of my close friends that were also friends of the house, and had some pretty exceptional barbecue (and, as a Texan, I have high standards for barbecue). Through the whole thing, I remember not feeling out of place or excluded from anything—it all felt very natural, and I rarely felt like I had to put on any performance of who I was to not “stand out.” 
The next day, with SAE, I found myself in even-middler-of-nowhere Massachusetts at Skeet Shooting (aka shooting clay targets with shotguns), which I had only ever seen at the shooting range down the road from my house (again, Texan). The van ride to the range was quite long, but it was a great opportunity to continue talking to the different brothers and scoping out how good of a fit SAE might be for me. Again, I felt for the most part comfortable through the event; though the conversations did feel a bit different than the way I usually spoke to my friends, I think a lot of that could be chalked up to the fact that we didn’t really know each other, and I had the realization that I could see myself, in my authenticity, being close friends and having long, casual conversations with the SAE brothers, which I couldn’t say about a lot of the frats I’d interacted with in the past few days.
Skeet shooting itself was a grand old time, and by the end, I was able to successfully shoot two targets in reasonably quick succession. Which, sure, sounds unexciting, but was actually quite a milestone (because I had been missing too often and needed to prove myself before we left). We rolled out in the two SAE vans and stopped by some ice cream shop with a funny name that I can’t for the life of me remember before returning to campus and getting back to the daily affairs. There was much to do, as the next day was the first day of classes, and so after being dropped off (at, in fact, the MIT Admissions office for my first Blogger Meeting!) I returned to my room to ground myself for the coming year, to think about everything I’d done these past few days… and, it seems, to begin to doubt.
 
Day 5: Everything I Am
The first day of classes was, of course, a whirlwind. Actually, it was fine, because I had exactly one lecture, but nonetheless. The sense that I was stepping into a new phase of my life should have been familiar, what with how many such steps I’d taken in the past few weeks, but it was still just as much of a smack in the face as ever. And though Wednesday was light, I knew the next day was going to be looong, and I was… not exactly looking forward to it.
Throughout the day, I spent a lot of time thinking about my experience so far with Rush. I didn’t plan on going to any events that day, and I noticed that I was feeling pretty drained come Day 5 of the whole process. I wasn’t even going to all that many events, to be honest—yet somehow, I felt worn. I realized that I had spent every single moment of the day thinking about Rush—rationalizing, considering, weighing, wondering, reconsidering, parsing, realizing, contemplating, convincing, deciding. It was consuming my every waking moment as I tried to fit this unfamiliar paradigm into my familiar lifestyle, and it was starting to feel overbearing.
Were the events fun? Yeah, for sure. Were the guys I had met people I would want to call my brothers? I would say so, yes—I was surprised by how welcomed I had been by the community. Was I accepted in the spaces I stepped into? I was, fully.
But was this right for me? And why, exactly, was I doing it?
Was I looking for a community? Not really, no; I was already surrounded by rich, diverse communities at my every turn. I had my friends from Simmons, my freshman year neighbors, my radio friends, the EESA, my Orientation teams, and more. I felt in no way at a lack of community, and the fact that a fraternity happened to be a predominantly male space didn’t make it more intrinsically valuable than any other space I found myself occupying. And I’d already promised myself staunchly that, if I were to end up in a frat, I wasn’t going to allow it to take away time that I spent with the communities who had accepted me without a week-long trial. I was already surrounded by love. And I was fulfilled with it.
Was I trying to prove that I could do it, and to whom? If my motivation was sticking it to those guys from my high school, then that meant I was still giving them power over me because I was doing all of this just to show them that they were wrong. Just like they did in high school, they were dictating where I could and couldn’t go. But what about where I wanted to go? Only I could drive that. And if I was trying to prove to myself that I was capable of being in a “men’s space” without feeling out of place or excluded, then I’d already done that through Rushing—and it felt like an insufficient motivator to support me going all the way through with the process, even if I were to receive a bid from one of the frats.
Was I forcing myself out of my own skin out of dissatisfaction with the person that I was? Signs pointed to yes. I felt like I wasn’t enough of a “guy” sometimes, in how I spoke and dressed and carried myself and thought about the world around me. And I felt like others saw it too, and I noticed it. I always noticed it. When guys would treat me a bit different than the others around me. When they would dap up my friend and then just awkwardly say hey to me. When they seemed less jovial, less funny, less outgoing when I was around because they couldn’t use the same jokes or the same words when I was in their space. Every time, I noticed, and I carried—I carry—it. And as friendly and welcoming as the frats that I found myself rushing were, there were always moments that I felt like I had to be just a little bit different than I usually was. Tell different jokes. Use different words. Laugh at different things. I wanted to fit in so badly that I was showing the world someone else, someone slightly better than me, expecting that if they accepted him that they would accept me too, knowing that wasn’t really how it worked but thinking, praying, that it was my best shot. But I was never going to get anywhere if I kept forsaking the person that I knew myself to be in exchange for someone that I could present myself as so that a small group of people might like me a little bit more.
And most pivotally—was I Everything I Think I Am Not? 
I was. 
But I was also Everything I Am. And I found myself wholly unwilling to rip myself out of the context of my life, out of my beliefs, out of my voice, out of my self, to try and craft someone else for the sake of proving someone wrong about me—for that matter, to prove myself wrong about me. Because, I found, I had only proven myself correct: about my values that I would safeguard staunchly; about my voice that made me who I was; and about where I could fit in if I so chose—anywhere. There were no bounds on who I could be, no guardrails to where I could grow, but I also found that there was so much that I already was, and he deserved to be considered, cherished, celebrated too. I had to stop rejecting the person that I was in exchange for someone I thought I “wanted” to be.
And so, I modified the mantra—because I wasn’t just everything I think I am not.
I am everything I am, anything I’m not.
 
Day 6: Would You Be Happy?
In finding this deep resolve with myself, the next day it came time to make an important decision: was I going to continue rushing? It was fun, and it was an adventure, but my motivations felt flawed. I didn’t want to turn myself into someone else when I’d just come to terms with the person that I was, but I also wanted to live in the moment and try something new. 
I was bouncing back and forth between continuing Rush and choosing to eject myself from the whole affair when I received a particularly frank text from Sydney P. ‘27, who I had been talking to extensively about my difficult position:
would you be happy in a frat?
And the answer was shockingly clear: no, not really. Or at least, not happier than I was at the moment, as she clarified in the next message (which I left out above so that the one line could have more dramatic weight). 
And, in that moment of clarity, it became obvious that I didn’t want to continue Rush. Changing myself to fit in, chameleoning for the shot at community, it wasn’t going to make me happy. I had had a lot of fun, definitely, but if I was going to Rush, I wanted to do it for myself—for the boy I already am. I wanted to show him to the world and let them accept or reject him as they pleased. But that wasn’t what I had been doing, and I didn’t want to continue on that path knowing that the cost of it would be me. And in coming to terms with it, I came to terms with myself as well. 
That week taught me so much about myself, as I found myself telling Noah R. ‘27, that night. To quote some texts that I sent him—it showed me how much I value community and how I put time into the people that matter to me. It showed me that I didn’t really need a “strong male community” because the people who embraced me embraced me for who I was, and the diversity in those communities is what made my life so vibrant and the perspectives I was able to share in so meaningful. It showed me that, really, I was wholly disinterested in rewriting the person that I already am to fit into someone else’s image of me or to seem acceptable to a community whose validation served no purpose other than fulfilling a sense of exclusivity and homogeneity. It showed me that “a chance” from a bunch of people who would probably laugh at me behind my back if I wasn’t retaining a careful mirage to impress them is ultimately worth nothing at all except the knowledge that I can put on and remove masks of my persona to chameleon into spaces rather than be content with the spaces that have accepted me maskless.
And as he asked me if I was happy that I had rushed, the answer flowed from my fingers with ease.
i’m happy that i rushed because i learned i didn’t need to.
 
Day 7: The Last Hurrah
It was Friday. Rush lasted for most frats until either Friday or Saturday, when they would host their Bid Dinners and then tell the invited rushers that they had received a bid and were welcome in the brotherhood. SAE was the only fraternity that I was still rushing when I decided that I was ending the process, and a part of me had almost hoped that they’d forgotten about me. The guys were all friendly, I felt happy in the community, and I could see myself spending more time around them, but I knew that for my sanity and my sense of self, I couldn’t keep Rushing this semester, and I didn’t want to have to break that news to any of the guys that I’d met that week.
Unfortunately, I had no such luck, and as I woke up that morning I found an Instagram DM from Nathaniel inviting me to a dinner on Friday night, which he particularly noted was the last event before the bid dinner on Saturday.
I really liked Nathaniel, and Jonathan, and Addison and Lance and Tommy and Thomas and Eddy and Minh and Jacob and everyone else that I’d met. They were funny, and the conversations that I’d had were rich, and I didn’t feel all of the pressures to be someone else when I was around them. Separated from the context of everything I wrote above, I’d be perfectly happy to show up to the dinner that day, accept the suggested invitation to the coming bid dinner, and go forward with my life as a brother of SAE. But I knew that that separation was impossible—we exist in the context—and thus, I knew that I wasn’t ready to be in a frat. 
And so, with a bit of a heavy heart, I wrote up a reply to Nathaniel—thanks for inviting me to dinner tonight […] i’ve come to the decision that i’m not going to continue the rush process, at least for this semester […] i just don’t think this is the right moment and course of action for me and where i’m at right now […] i really appreciate everything from this past week and hope to still keep in touch!! thanks sm
I looked over the message, and in it I felt some resolve. I went in on my own terms, and I was stepping out on my own terms. I’d done Rush just how I wanted to, and I’d found more of myself for it. It wasn’t the outcome that most guys would hope for—a bid—but it was exactly what I wanted it to be: an opportunity for me to grow and learn about who I was, a chance for me to take the reins of who I could or couldn’t be. 
And thus, I took a deep breath, readied myself to mark the end of my wholly unique Rush experience, and with some sense that the turning point had found me already, lifted my finger and hit Send.",[]
I Made MIT-ish ASMR,Aiden H. '28,16 ,"November 24, 2025",,[]
at a distance,Victor D. '27,3 ,"November 20, 2025","A few days ago,⁠01at the time of writing one of my best friends from home, Ariana, posted a picture with a balloon spelling “21.”
Her birthday was about a month ago and I completely forgot! :(
I sent a happy belated birthday message. It made me really think about just how disconnected I am from people at home—some of the people that used to know me best.
Around this time 3 years ago, I was a senior in high school applying to college. After 17 years (and soon to be 18) in my hometown, I was growing anxious, antsy, and impatient. I really just wanted to get out of high school and away from home.
Recently, I’ve started to see these years in a new light. I’m starting to feel increasingly nostalgic for my experiences back then.
Our table in honors math freshman year. Quarantine bike rides. Picnics on the grass in Adolfo Park on a cloudless day under the oaks. Smash Ultimate sessions at my friends’ houses. Scurrying around campus during lunch to various club events and to find friends.
our picnic platter! (11/29/2020)
When I first tried to write this, I found myself rehashing a perspective that I hadn’t updated since high school. The words were bitter and, as I wrote it, I stopped and realized “Wait, I don’t think I believe that anymore. That’s not how I feel at all about it now, or at least my perspective is more nuanced now that I’m an observer to my past.” Sure, there were some abjectly terrible times during high school but, at the same time, I wonder if I spent enough time truly appreciating the good moments. At least I’m trying to do that now.
I miss my friends from home. I often wonder what they’re up to. When I see something I think they’d like (a funny quote, a duck, a video), I send a text with it. The truth is though, it’s been months since I’ve heard the voice of any of my friends from home. While I do keep up with their lives in some way through social media, it really isn’t the same as a proper conversation.
As I pass my halfway mark here at MIT, the memories of my past grow hazier. I’m fortunate my journal captured at least some of my thoughts from back then, for the person’s eyes who saw the world that way are dead, or at least have been subsumed through new experiences and contexts.
There’s a tradeoff: as key events in my life and the people from my past grow fuzzier, my mind fills with new experiences and new people. When my mom asks me “Remember so-and-so with the long hair—what was his name?” I often remember who these people are in theory but not really who they are—were? People pass in and out of our lives but sometimes we want them to stop and wait with us just a bit longer. In the rush of life, you sometimes don’t even realize when they’re passing out of your life. One day, you know who they were and then… they fade into nothing but a name.
I’m at a stage where I still remember glimpses from high school but the memories are shadows. What once might have sparked a visceral response now feels largely depersonalized and foreign.
Thinking about this past makes me sad that some of my closest relationships now only exist at a distance. That we don’t see each other more than 3-4 times a year. But at the same time, I find my past and continued relationships extremely compelling.
When I visited my friend Eyouel at UC Berkeley last IAP,⁠02Independent Activties Period, mini term during January he told me:
“I don’t think we’re close friends anymore, Victor.”
Ouch. But it’s fair. We used to talk every day for several hours a day and now… virtual silence, for months at a time. What does it mean to stay “close” when you no longer share a daily life?
Another time, I was sitting with Ariana in the parking lot in front of Rolling Pin Donuts in Camarillo—the same one surrounded by a parking lot next to a car repair shop and a gas station my dad, my dog Ladybird, and I would run/scooter to on weekend mornings when I was a kid.
Ariana said:
“We have to realize that this is just how our friendships are now, now that we only see each other a few times a year.”
Ouch, again. And what exactly did she mean by how? Honestly, I’m still trying to figure that out. Part of it is the pressure to try to spend as much time as possible with friends and family when I’m home. Part of it is the scramble to fill in the gaps: what happened to this person over the past 3-9 months. And then trying to reciprocate, compressing an entire semester into a few highlights.
Except you no longer have the benefit of a continuous, shared context.
Part of it is reconciling who we were before and who we are now.
arguably my city’s most iconic landmark lol
These questions remain elusive, but I have a few steps to take that should help:
Carve out time to call more people. Unfortunately, the 3-hour time difference makes this really difficult, on top of everyone already being busy.
Lock in on actually starting my book club with some friends at home.
Respond to my texts consistently even as the fire hose propels me off the face of the planet.
Have an existential crisis because this will probably happen again after MIT. Except it’ll be worse, because everyone will disperse everywhere instead of mostly clustering in one place (California).
Since I wrote this entry, I actually have managed to call and message several friends from home (yippee).  But I’m still looking to answer the question Ariana posed: how our relationship is going to be going forward.
She did, however, tack one hopeful thing onto that rather sobering statement:
“But it’s so nice to be able to hang out and pick up where we left off as if we were never apart.”

I Went To The Ballet!,Aiden H. '28,2 ,"November 18, 2025","This past weekend, I went to my first ballet!
Unfortunately, my previous level of knowledge of ballet was at best mediocre. I know vaguely of tutus and the word pirouette, but I haven’t even seen The Nutcracker,⁠01I was supposed to go in kindergarten but I VIVIDLY remember lining up single-file to get on the bus, and on the way out of the classroom I threw up all over the rainbow carpet and had to go home sick for the first time much less anything more. In fact, the only live ballet I have ever been to is my sister’s dance recitals,⁠02my sister herself was not in ballet, but all the groups had one recital when the three-year-old ballerinas would come hobble around and everyone would aw (including me).
This was of course until people from floorpi⁠03my floor in east campus informed me that day-of tickets to the Boston Ballet are only $20, and they were planning to go. With nothing better to do and $20 to spare, I headed off to the Citizen’s Opera House!!

The Opera House itself was stunning enough to deserve a visit, but when I tell you the ballet itself, for lack of a better word, completely and utterly GAGGED me.
The show we saw is called “Jewels”, which is a three-act ballet created by George Balanchine, cofounder of the New York City Ballet, aka one of the biggest names in ballet ever, aka head honcho (RIP). Each act is represented by a different jewel, each of which corresponds to a city with a distinctive ballet style and in which Balanchine lived.
First was “Emerald”, representing Paris. The set was completely minimalistic, decorated only with a green backdrop. From there, dancers came in what my friend says is “traditional French ballet attire”, meaning fluffier tutus instead of skirts and longer shirts for the men. The style itself was very…flowery? Instead of being high energy, it was more of a faerie aesthetic, with a lot of focus on the arms and the artistic nature of the body (as opposed to technique or hype factor). The orchestral arrangement (performed by a live orchestra!) was very spring.
Second was “Ruby”, representing New York City. This was by far my favorite act, and I feel like most of the crowd felt this way! This featured what I can only describe as faster and more flashy dances. The music was more upbeat with a swinging, jazzy style. The dancers were focused on getting the most from the movements themselves, performing a bunch of shorter routines in groups of twos and threes. This also features a duet that was absolutely one of the greatest things I have ever seen–there was actively clapping starting halfway through because everyone was so impressed. We also got the principal dancers for the duet, so it felt even more special.
Third was “Diamonds”, representing Russia. Meant to highlight the difficulty and technique of ballet, this act very much felt like a large ballroom dance, fit with a bedazzled chandelier hanging from the ceiling. There were the most people on stage (about 30) doing a bunch of synchronized and symmetrical moves across the stage. It felt much more theatrical than championing a solo routine, which made it more of a spectacle to watch. And, of course, the grand finale finished with a series of difficult moves by soloists that I could not begin to name, but that I know if I ever had to put my body in those positions (much less hold them for the minutes they did), I would leave Earth.
Not only do I feel a newfound appreciation for ballet (and ~the arts~), but I also gain a sense of wonder at any live performance. Even getting dressed up and going into the city, only to be greeted by the warm, sparkling opera house is enough for me to be taken completely out of the MIT bubble I’m constantly trapped in. I want to go out, I want to have experiences and be a person in a city doing all of the things that one can. Each minute at my desk feels like a minute wasted doing everything outside of here. There’s a sense of doing something–taking the T, seeing a movie, going to a restaurant, seeing a show–that makes me feel so adult, so city, whereas most of the time I feel like a soul tethered to my desk chair, questioning why I do things like MIT in the first place. But then it’s that city aesthetic, of being an “adult” in the real world that pulls me back in. Of waking up in an apartment, going to do work in my fancy adult business clothes that were reasonably expensive, going home at 5 to do things like cook a real dinner and have plans after. As much as I hate to admit it, I want that mystical, unrealistic, I’m-upper-middle-class-and-happily-live-in-a-sitcom lifestyle. In order to get there, I have to do this first, or I would probably just be trapped in my hometown. It might be a fantasy I sell myself, or a facade I buy into, but those are intriguing for a reason: because they’re pretty.
And sometimes I just want to look at pretty things, like jewels.","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snapchat-1789193634-800x1422.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snapchat-1333550281-800x1422.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snapchat-1327010772-800x1422.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snapchat-1563183500-800x1422.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snapchat-1143845742-800x1422.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snapchat-483492645-800x1422.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snapchat-180918312-800x1422.jpg']"
scuba do or scuba don’t?,Taylor L. '29,3 ,"November 17, 2025","Every Thursday at 6:45pm for about two months, I trudged fifteen minutes across campus to the Alumni Wang Fitness Center ⁠01the lesser-known younger brother of the Zesiger Fitness Center  in my Crocs, pool towel in hand, for my PE class. The locker rooms of Wang are like the backrooms, and after taking a few turns, you end up at the pool. The first time I went, I thought I got lost and ended up at the boiler room instead, but it was just the dedicated scuba closet. 
As part of our graduation requirements, we have to earn eight “PE points,” which can be fulfilled by taking four PE classes. Each class is worth two points, and it’s a slightly convoluted system. 
However, there’s a special subset of PE classes that are “Extreme,” and that give double the amount of PE points (4 points! I’m halfway done). Included among these are things like kayaking, backpacking, rockclimbing, and parkour. 
Scuba has been five weeks in the making, since I passed the swim and boat test (100 yard swim and five minutes treading water, respectively) during the first weekend of orientation. Little did I know that the first day of scuba class, they would make us swim double of the boat test (200 yard swim and 10 minutes treading water). 
What I also didn’t realize going into this was that scuba-ing itself is pretty easy so long as you can swim. There’s really only one rule, which is that bad things happen if you start breathing through your nose, so you inhale and exhale exclusively through that little mouthpiece,⁠02mouthbreathing final boss which is called the regulator. 
As a result, the classes are basically simulating every single possible thing that could go wrong and learning how to address them. The scenarios we looked at include losing your goggles, losing your snorkel, losing your regulator, losing your air tank and gear entirely, basically losing anything that’s attached to you that keeps you alive, dragging your diving buddy to safety, and disconnecting the air flow so that you can’t breathe for a few seconds. 
There were also some lighter, less perilous activities, like underwater agility courses, passing around torpedoes (which reminded me of playing at the neighborhood pool as a kid), swimming upside down, and underwater Scrabble. 
Afterwards, there’s classroom sessions where you’re basically told all of the horrible things that can happen if you dive irresponsibly. 
Ironically, it’s a great mood booster because of unfortunate scheduling on my part. 8.01 ⁠03Classical Mechanics problem sets are due every Thursday at 11pm, but the earliest I have ever submitted an 8.01 pset is at 10:42 pm,⁠04I set a new record since writing this, at 10:30pm!! I'm so cooked and they are due at 11:00. Procrastination is a lifestyle, and I take it seriously. 
I always found that the impending deadline completely vacated my mind when I was diving because it was just fun to be twelve feet underwater on a random Thursday evening. However, it did come at a cost, because scuba ends at 10pm, giving me only an hour to finish the pset afterwards. I’m usually scrambling for the entire morning Thursday trying to chip away at that mountain of rotational motion problems. I even had to skip scuba once to finish the pset (and I did finish it, somehow still within twenty minutes of the deadline, even with three extra hours).
All of this is a good example of an issue I’ve run into a bit while I’ve been here: prioritization. 
It’s not groundbreaking to point out that college is a time of extreme freedom, but it’s definitely become apparent that having to pick and choose really forces you to examine what you want to allot your time to. My three hour scuba diving class is interesting, and I want to learn new and interesting things, but I also need to learn old and boring things like physics, ⁠05just kidding! i love physics 🫣 and also pass my classes, and there’s only so much time in the day for all of that, and there’s even less time on Thursday. 
As a side note, in order to address my homework, I’ve developed something I like to call the Poor Man’s Pomodoro Technique. Maybe you’re familiar with the traditional Pomodoro Technique, where you set a timer for a specific amount of time (typically 25 or 50 minutes), and then take five or ten minute breaks between work sessions. 
My variation doesn’t even require you to have a separate timer. You start a work session, you work until your computer dies, and then you get to go home. It works better the older and worse your computer is, too, because the battery will give out sooner. It has been a game changer for my productivity, especially after I realized that I really had to lock in for 8.01. 
At the end of the class, after seven sessions, I had the option to do a scuba certification dive so that I could dive anywhere in the world, but I honestly just forgot to schedule it, so that’s on pause until the spring. But luckily there isn’t a due date on that one.",[]

Our performers mopped up the stage with paper towels, and our lovely performers fully committed to their choreographed groundwork, rolling and cartwheeling through puddles and the piss of Zeus himself with only the fire of their props to keep them warm. When the rain started pouring too hard to even see, we ushered the audience into Stata to wait it out for 20 minutes. We set up camping tents to keep our props and equipment dry. People were swapping costumes soaked in sweat and tears and mostly rainwater. As wonderful as the shows went, and as much as it was worth it, shifting schedules for one show and coming back to our dorms drenched and shivering for another was still unpleasant.

We had the frosh do a delay-the-rain dance yesterday after dress rehearsals, yelling and wiggling our arms at the clouds. Because since nothing else has worked at this point, we might as well try.
I don’t know where the lair of the weather wizard lies. He, the arch-nemesis of our fire dragons, is the only one standing in the way of a dry and happy audience and the perfect show. I do not know what grudge he harbors and what staff he wields. I would like to think it is a short and shriveling twig casting a pathetic twinkling of dew in attempt to douse our flames. But alas, he can only delay our display of fiery awesomeness on the best outdoor stage in the greater Boston-Cambridge area.

So this is an advertisement. Please if you are a weatherman or a meteorologist or a witch or a rain and wind shaman, please please PLEASE help us schedule the show for a day that doesn’t rain and take down the evil wizard operating the MIT weather machine.
Also, Novemburn is still on Sunday(tomorrow) 8-10pm in Stata Amphitheatre.

cute date ideas,Ellie F. '28,4 ,"November 11, 2025","It’s Veteran’s Day, which means it’s been one year since my For Real Official Actual First Date here at MIT. Because I’m sentimental, here’s a list of fun Ellie-tried-and-tested things to do with one or more people that you love, for any definition of love <3
I’ve roughly grouped these by distance from where I live. Let me know if there’s anything else cool that I should check out :)
In dorm
I live in Simmons, so your mileage may vary.
Take advantage of the craft room
Ideas! Paint something together, fold origami (if you’re folding with someone else, try something modular!), or create a gift with the yarn and fabric supplies.
Make fancy desserts in the dining hall
Because if I’m paying that much for a swipe I may as well feel like I had a bougie meal.
Bake in the kitchen
Solder stuff in the EE lab
Study breaks
Simmons has insanely good study breaks. In the past month, we’ve averaged about two a week, with cake, cookies, apple cider donuts, s’mores, and more. This is a fantastic way to make people come over to study so that I don’t have to leave my room.

On campus
Enjoy some shows! 
I have to plug Video Game Orchestra (VGO), Asian Dance Team (ADT), and Next Sing of course :) but there’s also lots of theatre, like Shakespeare Ensemble, LOST, and Musical Theatre Guild. Dance shows are a blast, and you can NOT miss fire-spinning arts shows (some of the bloggers perform in those!)
More study breaks but this time on campus
Mostly I mean Weekends @ MIT, which hosts a great study break every Friday night. I’ve especially loved chocolate night (I took home so much Ghiradelli), Bob Ross night, and gingerbread house making (we made Simmons). Apart from Weekends, there’s also some cute events by other clubs, like the Undergraduate Society for Women in Math (USWIM).
Rush frats
I might be a girl but those all-male frats are giving out steak and lobster with no discrimination. Enjoy the hell out of those huge rush budgets. 
Visit the MIT Museum
Explore campus
I like the view from the top of the Green Building (and there’s secret Good Hot Chocolate in there too). Another fond memory was reading every poster in the astro building (Building 37).
Speaking of astro check out the sky
The light pollution is a bit horrendous here but in 12.409 Intro to Hands On Astronomy, we got to go out on the roof of Building 37 and take astrophotography. We also drove out to Haystack Observatory, where there are way more stars :)
Take a PE class
Learning to waltz is a very useful skill if you’re determined to break it out at every possible opportunity.
oh look its stata
we got this drawing prop from watching love's labours lost

In Boston/Cambridge
Boy do I love shows!
I love classical music (thanks Dad), so the BSO college card is amazing for me. MIT provides discount tickets to the Boston Ballet, so I’ve been to the Nutcracker and Swan Lake too. I also recently went to my first non-classical concert :0
Man am I a sucker for museums!
MIT provides free access to the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Institute of Contemporary Art, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. We like to bring sketchbooks and draw all the pretty things we see.
Playgrounds
Last spring, a few of us went on a playground crawl, which is kind of like a bar crawl except instead of alcohol there are swing sets. We went to about four or five playgrounds, though we didn’t make it to the Cop Slide, which unironically is my favorite playground ever.
Walk
Cross a bridge, go into Boston Commons, look for ducks, find yourself downtown and check out a ritzy hotel, browse Newbury Street, follow the Green Line, spend too long in a bookstore, walk up North End and then down into Seaport. Walking with people is the best.
Pretend you go to another school
My first finals week, we eschewed studying for Chemistry in favor of climbing BU’s Jenga building. When the snow froze into smooth ice in February, we slid around Harvard Square and made a fool of ourselves.
Pretend you have money 
We went to Macy’s and tried on a bunch of expensive suits and dresses and also apparently you can do makeup there and they won’t stop you.
PUZZLES!!!!
I’ve had a lot of fun WINNING at Red Fox Escapes, an escape room company on Mass Ave, and Boda Borg, which is a giant collection of escape rooms and obstacle courses you can try over and over again. Additionally, BAPHL (Boston Area Puzzle Hunt League) runs an in-person puzzle hunt about twice a year.

Outside Boston
Pick apples
Every fall, DormCon (and various other groups) has a huge apple-picking trip, and I never got the appeal of biting straight into an apple until I went on one of these.
Go to a dorm retreat
I will get a good grade in Simmons Hall, which is both normal to want and possible to achieve.
Hike in New Hampshire
Or Maine, if you’re willing to drive further. Remember, before we had “touch grass,” there was “go take a hike.”
Nyc
This is probably the canonical spring break trip for people traveling. Yes, we went to a museum every day.

Reflections from the STARS@MIT Fly-In,Sara N. '28,2 ,"November 11, 2025","From October 16-19, MIT hosted twenty juniors in high school for our second-ever Small Town and Rural Students (STARS) @ MIT Fly-In program. Students spent the weekend exploring the city, attending workshops, and getting a glimpse of life at MIT. Learn more about the program, and the nationwide STARS College Network, here. 
At the conclusion of the program, we asked students to share their reflections on their background, their weekend on campus, and where they hope to go next. Hear straight from them:
Tell us a bit about your hometown, your interests, what you like to do for fun! What made you want to come to the MIT fly-in?
“I live in a small town in Tennessee. There’s not much here, so the community is tight knit. For example, on the day of my return, they had a hotdog eating competition at a local gas station. Around here there are several golf courses which fuels my passion for golf. I love playing golf and making connections with people who share a similar interest. I enjoy socializing with friends and people in the community, as we all share common ground of what is home. I wanted to come to the MIT fly-in program because I wanted to see the opportunities outside of a small town. I wanted a new perspective on the types of people and ideas that lie in a prestigious environment like the MIT campus.”
– Aden G., Tennessee
“My hometown is a rural (and remote) town of about 15,000 people, with one regular public high school and not many opportunities. I usually spend my free time playing volleyball, reading, or walking around Front Street with my friends. When I found out about this MIT Fly-In, I was immediately interested. I really enjoy doing math, and prefer science to the humanities. I knew MIT was the best of the best, and I figured it was worth a shot to apply. I’m so glad I did, because this was an amazing experience.”
– Alison K., Louisiana
“I live in a town of around 4,000 people, and a two hour drive from the nearest Walmart. I am interested in the future of propulsion in space, and enjoy a variety of activities, ranging from small engineering projects at my house, to running, backpacking, and skiing. I applied to this fly-in because I was curious about MIT’s environment, and what kind of students the school looks for. I want to become an engineer, so finding a good school with an environment that fits me is something really important to me.”
– Priscilla P., Idaho
“My hometown is a little place in the middle of a bunch of corn fields, in my free time I enjoy reading comic books and working on my personal projects. I’ve wanted to attend MIT for years and I was shocked when I heard about this program as it seemed like it was designed specifically for me, as soon as I saw the website I knew I had to apply.”
– Carter A.
 
Was this your first time in Boston? How did you feel about the city?
“This was my first time in Boston! I loved the city! It was interesting going to the Public Garden because of the different perspective on nature, but it did feel really peaceful. I loved the back alleys and tiny streets because they felt so cozy. Everybody had their front steps decorated for fall and it made the street look so alive, even though there weren’t a lot of people around. I loved the views of the skyline from across the river. I loved the architecture and seeing the historical aspect of Boston.”
– Avery, Ohio
“Yes, it was my first time in Boston. It really boosted my view of “big cities” and made me more open to potentially going to college in an urban environment.”
– Hawa, West Virginia
 
What was your favorite part of the program? What was the most valuable part of the program/your biggest takeaway?
“I really liked staying in the dorms. I have been to 4-H conferences held on a college campus, but it was during summer. I haven’t experienced active college campus life until now. It was really different to be in a dorm full of people. East campus was also just amazing. There were murals all over the walls, and a silly cat.
My biggest takeaway is that maybe our wildest dreams are actually somewhat realistic. I think for a lot of small town/rural students it’s harder to see ourselves as capable of something bigger. To have the encouragement and validation from the admission officers & ambassadors was really special. Hearing that we all have something that MIT wants in a student really helped build my confidence in my future.”
– Alex B., Oregon
“My favorite part of the program was attending an engineering room where we learned how to solder. Additionally, I was intrigued to learn the symbols of a battery, LED light, switch, etc. Having the opportunity to not only learn, but act on the knowledge that we gained was truly valuable.
The most valuable part of the program was the emphasis of community pride and personal autonomy that the admissions officers made. Coming from a rural town, one can experience doubt and uncertainty about applying to college, but talking to the admissions officers made me see college admissions in a more positive perspective. I have realized it is a human connection between two people, one who truly wants to understand the core of you.”
– Marlyn A.
“Seeing and experiencing the beautiful MIT campus, meeting real college students, and learning more about the college admissions process.”
– Aurora M., Alaska
“My biggest take away is the diversity. My host introduced [me] to the Indigenous community on the Mit campus and I got to meet a Navajo (same tribe as me). He is currently working on Post-Phd education (…) From that I got a new understanding of what I can do and [that opened] my eyes to bigger possibilities.
More of the talk with my Navajo colleague here he had a Phd and is going to get more school. I found that so bizarre but quickly talking to him it gave me a new perspective on what I’m capable of especially being rural and a minority. I asked him how being in the city does to one’s mental from the cherished Rez but he reassured me talking about every land is Native land and which made my heart smile.”
– Isaiah H.
 
What are your plans after high school? What do you want to be?
“After high school, my plans are still not definite, but right now, I want to work at the intersection of aviation and Earth’s sustainability while helping advance aero/astro research. I’ve always been fascinated by space and flight, and as a huge Star Wars fan, I’d love to help create the kinds of technologies that once seemed impossible, while still staying conscious of the beautiful world that surrounds us.”
– Massimiliano M., Texas
“After highschool I want to go to a 4 year college for Computer science, and if at all possible I want that college to be MIT. I want to be a web designer right now, but I’m open to change”
– Donavin B., Colorado
“After high school, I plan on attending university and maybe graduate school as well. I would like to major in biomedical engineering and be a part of the researchers who are making new medical advancements, specifically on topics like Alzheimer’s disease or cancer.”
– Katie S., Texas
 
Any memory from the fly-in that you think will stick with you?
“I would say the biggest memory that I personally will have was when all of us were having dinner in the dining hall, the second day most of us eased up so we were all very comfortable with each other laughing and making conversation. That for me was a memory that I won’t forget from this trip.”
– Manuel R., California
“There are a lot to choose from, but I think my favorite is staying up way too late with my host and fellow MIT fly-in visitor talking about everything from politics to music, while I was being taught how to solve a rubix cube.”
– Nathan B., Texas
“While I think I’ll remember most of the fly-in for forever, I think the strongest memory is the rush of relief when I finally saw a fellow STARS student holding an MIT sign after walking through the airport for around half an hour.”
– Alison K., Louisiana
“A memory from the fly-in that will stick with me was getting to each lunch with the dean of admissions Stu Schmill. He had such interesting experiences from when he attended MIT!”
– Katie S., Texas
“Like I said before, overall, the people I met were amazing. If it wasn’t my fellow admits, who were constantly engaged and asking questions, sharing their small-town experiences, and connecting with stories similar to mine, it was the actual students at MIT. (…) I’ll also never forget the campus culture: the tunnel murals, the unique dorms, and the endless creativity all around. Everything about it was incredible, and I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to go.”
– Massimiliano M., Texas
I grew up completely mythologizing MIT. It was always larger than life for me. In certain ways, it still is, but I’m thankful I encountered people — teachers, mentors, upperclassmen — in high school that brought it down a little closer for me, close enough for it to be something I felt I could maybe even aspire to. I hope this program did something like that for some of our fly-in students.
This was my first year as a STARS ambassador & thus, this was my first fly-in — I loved it. Meeting the fly-in students, talking over dinner, getting to know the fly-in student I was hosting, I remember suddenly feeling distinctly grateful for my hometown — for all the ways it provided for me in my seventeen years before college, but also for all the ways it continues to provide for me: it’s allowed me to be a part of this wonderful community of both students older and younger than me, who bring such wealth of experience and whose depth & authenticity of passion constantly inspires me. Being from a “small place” is maybe just geographical fate, but it really does unlock a special community.
To any other students from small town or rural backgrounds who may be reading this blog right now: Please know that your presence is critically needed on college campuses around the nation.
In my time here so far, I’ve learned that one of the things that makes college so special is how it brings together people from incredibly different backgrounds and experiences. Learning, at its core, can perhaps be done from anywhere, but it is the confluence of various identities, a sort of collision of pasts and personalities, that allows new ideas and perspectives to brew.
As small-town/rural students, you all bring stories, resilience, and a one-of-a-kind frame of reference that is so incredibly invaluable in any room that is concerned with innovating with the world in mind. This is all to say: I know it’s easy to say and harder to do, but please don’t count yourself out. You are bringing a lot more to the table than you are probably giving yourself credit for. Have faith in yourself. Whether it’s at MIT or elsewhere, a two-year or four-year program, local or out-of-state – your future can manifest in so many varied, beautiful ways.
(If you are a small-town/rural student with questions about college, and you think talking to an MIT STARS Ambassador could help, please feel free to reach out! You can email student-specific questions to starsprogram[at]mit[dot]edu.)

one hour of musings,Kanokwan T. '26,2 ,"November 10, 2025","Hey, it’s been awhile since I’ve written here.
Activation energy is a funny little thing. As the days go on, it becomes harder to return. Subsequently, in effort to break that spell, I’ve set a one hour timer to write this blog. Limits define creativity, or whatever.
I’ve been away for awhile, cocooning. Life has thrown me some strange, tough obstacles. I thought it best to process those in private, in the pages of my paper journal. Being in the public is a vulnerable act. My situations made me fragile and raw, and I had to protect that. But, the chaos of life has subsided, at least for a wee bit, and I’m excited to be back.
—
Is this refined to my typical liking?
No.
Is this my best work?
Also no.
But is it something?
Yes!
And is there value in writing, again and again, putting thoughts out to share?
Of course.

So, what has happened?
To start off the summer, I conducted energy poverty field work in Patagonia with D-Lab. Self-built homes there require retrofitting for adequate energy access, temperature stabilization, and resident safety. My team and I worked throughout the spring semester on a demo for homeowners and policymakers to help advance housing work in response to climate change effects.
For most of the summer, I interned at the Berkeley National Lab on novel materials for energy storage. Specifically, I helped characterize clay-nanobubble water molecular gating, so basically seeing how scientists can fine tune fluids in clay. We used TEM, a microscopic technique that can see at atomic scale (like, it can see individual atoms) by precisely shooting beams of electrons and seeing what bounces back. It’s one of the most powerful microscopes in the world… so cool.
I broke my leg at a roller skating disco event. Whoops! At least, it was at a fun place. That was the worst physical pain I had ever been in. My tibia was snapped into different pieces, and my surgeon screwed it all back together with some metal plates and bolts. For three months, I was wheelchair-bound. It was a humbling experience—learning to use accessible restrooms, being carted around by friends, and being unable to go most places on my own. That requires its own blog to unpack. Fortunately, thanks to modern medicine, I’m back on my feet now. Months of physical therapy and check-ups lay ahead, but all doable.
My family has gone through… stuff. Heavy stuff. Stuff that I don’t think yet has a place on the blogs. But, I thought to mention it to contextualize the other things I’ve shared. Though I may be on some adventures abroad and working on cool research, there’s also been a heavyweight with it all. You never quite know what someone is going through, so extend kindness whenever possible. At least, that’s what I try my best to do.
Classes are so fun this semester. Here’s what I’m taking:
2.132: Instrumentation and Measurement
2.155: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Engineering Design
2.625: Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage: Fundamentals, Materials and Applications
12.385: Science, Politics, and Environmental Policy
I celebrated my birthday! In three and a half parts. I had my friends fill out a silly google form full of silly questions (that’s the half). Then, the three events commenced.
We ate cake on my dorm floor. The baking chair made my favorite cake, red velvet.
A few of us jammed to Latin jazz at Wally’s Jazz Club, out in Boston. Excellent vibes, literally. I could feel the music waves pulsing through me.
I hosted a virtual game night. I’ve found friendships through all phases of life, and I wanted a way to see them all together. We played skribbl.io, jackbox.tv, and among us.

There you have it. That’s my ramble. You got one hour of me. Perhaps, this has cracked the ice.",[]
did you miss the EA deadline?,Victor D. '27,1 ,"November 5, 2025","For all of you that missed the Early Action deadline (November 1st), that’s fine! I didn’t apply EA either, mostly because of 1) procrastination 2) I was already feeling stressed with the UC⁠01University of California application that was due late November. I decided to take more time with my MIT application and ended up submitting in early January (around the deadline lol).
I found out about MIT⁠02i probably had already heard of it but this is my first recollection of MIT during quarantine in sophomore year of high school when our AP European History teacher had us think about our long term plans, including college. That’s when I stumbled upon a web page about Course 11-6, Urban Science and Planning with Computer Science, and realized that was what I wanted to do! I even emailed to ask more questions about the course and application process.
When I received a response⁠03i was happy to be acknowledged! to my email a couple months later, I was just starting junior year, and the college admissions process was now less than a year away. By this point, I had a better idea of what MIT was and just how competitive admissions can be, which felt daunting. Why go through so much effort to do an entirely separate application from my UC application and the Common App?
Despite some doubts (and anxieties) here are some reasons why I applied:
Course 11-6. Most universities don’t have undergraduate urban planning degrees and no other school in the country offers a degree that combines computer science and urban planning in this way (to my knowledge). I applied as a civil engineering major to nearly every other school because I knew I was broadly motivated by infrastructure systems and cities, which would’ve worked out, but Course 11-6 was an ideal fit for my intersecting interests in urbanism, spatial analytics, and transportation. MIT has a lot of other cross-disciplinary majors too if you’re curious about interleaving different subject areas.
Humanities! I was excited about the HASS requirement (8 humanities subjects to graduate) because I didn’t want to be in an environment of exclusively STEMlords. Luckily, there are a lot of people here that study the humanities—I have friends who like film, music, sociology, anthropology, linguistics… etc. I still haven’t decided on my concentration⁠04every MIT student has to take 3-4 subjects in a single humanities subject to graduate though…
Living in an urban center. I had lived my entire life in Southern California up to that point, in the same suburban city of around 70,000 surrounded by strawberry fields. I knew I wanted to live in a more dynamic urban environment for college, especially one where a lot of walking and biking would be part of my routine. Since I was fortunate to have visited Cambridge before applying, I knew it’d be the perfect environment because of its cyclability and walkability.
School size. MIT has the smallest class size of any school I applied to. It’s definitely nice to be in a more intimate environment when getting to know your professors, find research opportunities, and get individualized support (both academic and personal).
Nearby institutions. There are many other colleges in the Boston Metro Area so it’s relatively easy to escape the MIT bubble, which was also a draw for me while applying especially since MIT students can take classes at Harvard, MassArt, and Wellesley .⁠05even though i have yet to cross-enroll :( but stay tuned for next semester (hopefully i realize my dreams)
Working with friends. Some of my friends in high school were also applying, so it was fun to discuss the application and read each other’s essays. I enjoyed working on my application largely because I was co-working with friends :)
Lastly, if you’re feeling hesitant about applying because of admissions anxiety… I definitely sympathize. I was worried that my SAT math score wasn’t high enough, that I wasn’t valedictorian, that I hadn’t taken a gazillion APs, etc. When the narrative is that even being a valedictorian “isn’t enough” to get into MIT… it’s intimidating. The Blogs were really helpful to calm my anxieties, since the narrative about “stats” is pretty misguided when it comes to admissions .⁠06these decade, two decade old posts I read while applying in 2023 still hold true, imo... also it's kind of surreal reading some of this admissions lingo like 'hooks' and 'stats' after being tapped out for the past 2 years
So if something about MIT resonates with you, why not throw your hat in the ring?",[]
"I have never been trick-or-treating, (until now)",Nicole Cooper,1 ,"November 4, 2025","Confession: I had never been trick-or-treating. 

Not once. Not as a kid, not as a teenager, not even ironically in college.
When I tell people that, they look at me shocked, jaw to the floor like a scream mask.

In my hometown, the houses were so far apart you could yell “trick or treat” into the night and it’d just echo back at you. The idea of going door-to-door didn’t make much sense when “the next door” was half a mile down a gravel road. So every Halloween, my “route” consisted of exactly one stop: my grandma’s house, a quarter mile away.

We’d shuffle down the dirt driveway in our costumes, usually something my mother sewed for us planned with our winter coats. We would knock on her door and she would pretend to be all surprised for trick-or-treaters and she’d hand each of us a full-size chocolate bar. The good stuff. Then we’d drive to the school Halloween carnival, pin the nose on the jack-o-lantern and call it a night. That was Halloween. That was trick-or-treating.


Fast forward to this year, Boston.

I decided it was finally time to experience the real thing – but I guess I was the one handing out the candy. 

I dressed up as a black cat (classic, low effort, timeless) and joined my friends to hand out candy. I bought three huge bags, feeling very prepared. By 6:45 PM, I was completely out. Turns out Boston kids operate with MIT-level efficiency when candy is involved.

The sidewalks were pure chaos — a blur of dinosaurs, princesses, superheroes, and the family dressed like the MBTA. Parents clutched coffee cups, someone down the block was blasting Thriller, and at one point I saw a very COOL, but rare DeLorean.

What surprised me most wasn’t the chaos. It was how familiar it felt.

I saw so many of the same things I remembered from home like the same orange plastic pumpkin buckets, the same inflatable ghosts and spider webs tangled in the bushes. The same classic costumes: Spiderman, cows, pumpkins. (Truly, there’s always one kid dressed as a pumpkin. Tradition demands it.)

For a moment, I realized maybe I hadn’t missed out as much as I thought. The setting was different (actually outside not in my school gym) but the spirit of it was the same. Kids laughing.  Fun costumes. Some kids crying at the sight of a skeleton costume.  Smoke machines making the light spooky and the moon off in the distance crisp as could be.

That’s the funny thing about growing up rural: you don’t really know you’re missing something until you see it up close. When you live where houses are miles apart, the idea of walking door-to-door in costume feels imaginary. You just make your own version of things.
Watching Boston’s Halloween unfold reminded me that even across all that distance, across cornfields and city streets, people still find the same ways to celebrate. To gather, to laugh, to make fun out of the cold.

That’s something I think about a lot in admissions: how geography shapes experience, but also how it connects us. At MIT, we read applications from every kind of place — from kids who can optimize a candy route through twenty-seven houses to those whose “neighborhood” was three families and a field (and probably the most confusing corn mazes out there). The stories aren’t better or worse; they’re just different. But sometimes, those differences rhyme, and we need both stories present in classrooms to thrive.",[]
just one more gnome game,Ellie F. '28,3 ,"November 4, 2025","About a week ago, I was ensnared Google Gnome, courtesy of my quasi-roommate Cyan (it’s complicated but actually not. but I won’t elaborate though). She’s been playing for about a month, while the rest of my roommates (one of which is my actual roommate) play Hollow Knight Silksong. We were all in my room (along with my ex-roommate-in-law ??) when it struck.
Google Gnome Game and its consequences
have been a disaster for my productivity. I wake up and play gnome game. I finish writing up a proof and give myself five minutes of gnome game as a little treat. I keep introducing my friends to gnome game. My protege Joy is something of a prodigy, achieving the coveted 3k score within her first night of playing.
this is from my inciting roommate Cyan
Here is are some of my achievements in gnome game.
this was the first cool trick i discovered

My current forward record is 3278 (as of 11/4, one day after posting, it is now 3582 4389 IM GOATED), and my backward record is -143. Cyan’s records (and the best scores I’ve seen in person yet) are 3393 and -157. However, I’ve seen incredibly impressive runs by people online that go into the 10k region. Also, once my roommate managed to get a gnome stuck in a perfect up-down position and could only bounce extremely high. That was cool.
The people cannot stop talking about gnome game
“its always surprising how much you can play around and experiment in such a small game” -Cyan

Happy birthday Cyan! And reader, if you choose to take on the mantle of the gnome game, let me know how the journey fares.
SPOILERS AHEAD!!! (map details; strategies)
Any player of the game will quickly pick up on the main elements of this skill-based game. The only control is the space button, which accelerates the gnome downwards and has a cooldown (I will call these boosts). Mushrooms are bouncy, clouds provide some lift, and butterflies make you float at an unnatural and somewhat disturbing pace. On the other hand, mud has the power to get you stuck and almost always ends a run. But likely the most powerful tool in the game is the log cannon, which launches you very far very quickly. Getting into one can save a dying run, and timing boosts to enter logs is an essential skill to have.
Going forward, I will refer to the large pink gnome pictured above as the “best gnome”. If you have issues with this we can discuss in the comments.
Logs
When attempting to enter a log, the best strategy is to go in at a low angle, to reduce the chance of bouncing over the log. So, if I’m bouncing high near the log entrance, I try to wait until my bounces are smaller to advance into the log.
There are a few notable logs. For the casual player, the first goal is to get into the log at 47. There are also logs at 204 and 362 that always exist (Cyan has these memorized). However, by using the best gnome, one could wait a bit longer while in the catapult to get launched backwards. At -28, there exists a log (the “back log”) that launches the gnome about 500 forwards (“THE LOG AT -30 IS OP” -Joy), which skips a lot of the early gameplay and provides incredible momentum for the rest of the run. With the back log, I have been able to achieve 1500+ distances without touching my keyboard beyond the initial launch.
Rolling
When your gnome runs out of momentum, rolling is the only way to keep the run alive, usually through the hope that you can stagger your way to a log. The best gnome, by virtue of being the roundest, is best able to roll, as the pointier ones are often stuck on their sides. The best time to use a boost is usually when the top of the gnome’s left shoulder is down towards to ground, as the angle pushes the gnome forwards. This also works for other orientations of the gnome with a similar angle to the ground, but they’re harder to time correctly. It is also worth noting that gnomes are biased to go forwards, so if you just barely overshot a log, tough luck.
Map
There are many interesting features of the map. One, as mentioned, is the existence of the powerful back log. If a gnome bounces high enough, you can reach the stars, where gnome constellations live. Progression becomes extremely limited due to the “3k Mudfield”, which describes the muddy, godless wastes of the map beyond 3000. However, extremely skilled players can build up enough momentum to bounce out of the mud, and somewhere around 4500, the map simply ends (“The Far Lands”), and players can fall through the “ground” and gain distance until they lose all forward velocity (air resistance? floating point errors? cause is uncertain).
Similarly, players can also see the other extreme of the map. By launching from the catapult backwards and timing a boost on the back log, a gnome can bounce backwards into a region where the ground is not rendered but is simply cyan (haha like Cyan).
I can only aspire to be as talented at Gnome Game as Cyan
high score as of 11/4/2025: IM THE GOAT ???
Anyways, I’m back to playing gnome game now.

time travel is overrated,Boheng C. '28,0,"November 2, 2025","on the last day of freshman orientation, just a few days before i arrived at MIT, we all gathered in kresge auditorium for one final event. our assignment — the first assignment we got at MIT — was to write an email to our future selves, which would be automatically delivered to our inboxes at the end of freshman year. 
my letter, written while walking home from the auditorium, was a list of eleven questions. sadly, at the end of last year, i was too busy studying and organizing and last-minute packing and flying back home and visiting my old friends that i never had the time to answer my questions. 
but here they are at last, along with my best attempts responding to them — responses from both my current perspective and from my perspective when i first saw the email notification in my inbox, a moment buried four months in the past:
hi,
what classes are you taking?
right now, i’m taking⁠01i have many thoughts about all these classes, but that’ll be for a future post! 7.30 (fundamentals of ecology), 8.033 (relativity), 8.041 (quantum physics i), 21G.707 (spanish and latin american comics), and 24.906 (linguistic study of bilingualism). at the end of last semester, when i first received the email, i had just finished 6.200 (circuits and electronics, formerly 6.002), 7.05 (general biochemistry), 8.03 (vibrations and waves), 18.032 (differential equations), and wgs.303 (history of gender).
what do you do on a wednesday evening?
after i leave my last class (8.033), i walk back to my room. i finish copy editing articles for the tech, our student newspaper; i check the grammar and reword sentences until our deadline. 
i bike across campus to quizbowl⁠02jeopardy-style academic competition, but with teams practice. i am distracted though and i stare out the window at the charles river, fidget with the buzzer in my hands, scroll through pages and pages of dormspam⁠03an email mailing list to which nearly all undergraduate students are subscribed. at most hours of the day, it’s flooded with club advertisements and clothing sales and pleads for lost items — an incessant stream that most choose to filter from their main inbox. emails but hardly click on any. i walk back to my dorm through the infinite corridor, now filled with jugglers and their inquisitive onlookers. it’s getting dark, or maybe not quite dark but a blank tealish gray, and the warm indoor lighting is what the color of the sunset should be if we could banish cambridge’s godforsaken sad clouds.
i sit down in a lounge on my floor. i watch an 8.041⁠04quantum physics i, taught in a hybrid format; our lectures are pre-recorded (on opencourseware) and our psets are auto-graded, but our recitations and office hours are in-person lecture or read some linguistics papers as the kitchen saturates with the aromas of dinner imminent. 
but i usually don’t cook on wednesdays. instead, i bike to the dining hall at maseeh through a pitch-black outfinite. i walk back through killian court, through a path between the big dome and the charles river, and at times i stop and listen to the crickets and crane my neck upwards and watch the stars float overhead.
when i return, i begin reading graphic novels for my spanish class. i read deep into the night, interrupted perhaps by a biweekly housecomm⁠05the house committee (student government) of my dorm, east campus meeting or quantum mechanics questions; i read and read, in my room and in a lounge, until my head is inundated with too many new words and too little sleep and my eyelids spasm with the intoxication of fatigue. i sometimes finish the reading; often i don’t, but i plop onto my bed anyways and i dream happily.
are you talking to someone? a professor or classmate or roommate or friend?
as i’m writing this, i’m talking to a few friends who live on my floor (tetazoo) and some who live on the floor below us (beast). it’s late, so our conversation is punctured by long pauses and longing stares and it’s been slowly losing steam for the past few minutes. our conversation drifts; we’re talking about which places we want to go to this weekend, and many of us are hopelessly lost in phones or daydreams.
what do you think about building 9’s subbasement?
sadly not much :(
what’s the fastest path from simmons a tower tenth floor to the banana lounge entrance?
you already know the fastest path, but you might not know all of them. and there’s so many cool things that you get to see if you don’t take the fastest one!

basement corridor and machine room of building 13

the outfinite, which runs parallel to its more famous sibling (the infinite corridor)
basement tunnel system at the intersection between buildings 8, 16, and 26
intersection between mass ave. and vassar st., near the north end of campus
terrazzo mural floor of building 6c, which contains physics labs and the metropolis makerspace
and finally, the banana lounge itself!

have you ran into a red line [subway] station just as the train was departing?
i must have at some point, but i don’t recall when. perhaps the metro had just departed when i ran into the central square station, suitcase in tow, trying to catch a 10:30 am amtrak at boston south station bound for stamford. i might have stopped in exhaustion and caught my breath and panicked since i wouldn’t make the train. (thankfully, i did arrive on time, but only because i read the departure time wrong and i thought that it was going to leave a few minutes before it actually did.) 
or maybe i ran into the station as the metro was leaving when i entered alewife or harvard station to dodge wind or rain or just tiredness, to relieve myself from the obligation of biking home. i would’ve been content to be sheltered within the station’s dry warmth, even if it meant waiting for the next train.
or it could’ve happened on any number of occasions — impromptu trips to the aquarium or beach; a final trip to the airport at the end of fall semester, snow everywhere and 6 am; returning from late-night central square runs. it must’ve happened at some point.
have you felt snow?
yes!

do you still think the charles is pretty as the sun filters down through the trees and the crickets sing yet once again after the torment of rain and wind?
i do :)
where are you?
i’m typing on my phone and i’m with some of my friends, loitering in the stata loading docks⁠06an electronic waste dumpster located in the basement parking lot, serving as a transient graveyard for monitors, printers, keyboards, chairs, fridges, sometimes even lab equipment. many MIT students make frequent pilgrimages to the loading docks to cruft — that is, to dumpster dive and sort the functional devices from the broken. and wallowing in 1 am lethargy. (we didn’t end up finding anything worth taking, not that we had anything in mind that we wanted to find.)
when i first saw the letter in my inbox, i had just returned to my room back home⁠07i don’t really know what to call home anymore. i’m referring here to the house i lived in for most of middle and high school, which contains my bed and books and seven years of now-fleeting memories. but would it be wrong to say that MIT is also a home for me? would it be misguided to call my dorm room last year — with all its stuffed animals and chalk drawings and fairy lights — a home? since surely i made it home, or at least a home. and what about all the other places i’ve lived in? what about my childhood home in shanghai? what about my current dorm room, the place with most of the things that i know and hold dear? in short, i can’t really pinpoint a single place to call home anymore. but the same has been true since i left the world that i knew as a toddler and came to the united states — a new home. in los angeles, sitting at my desk for the first time in a year. it’s strange to think that i had sat there nearly every day since quarantine, and then one day i suddenly left for a faraway place called cambridge and didn’t come back for a short eternity. it was warm, warm enough that the air hugged and choked me in its palpable heat, so much more than the frigid puffer-jacket hellscape of cambridge⁠08it’s getting really cold here again and i don’t like that :(.
are you supposed to be here?
i don’t know. i don’t really understand what my past self meant by this question; i don’t really know what i meant by “supposed to be” or “here.”
if i assume “here” to mean “at MIT,” then i think the answer is both yes and no. yes, in the sense that everyone at MIT is supposed to be here; no, in the sense that many people who aren’t here are also supposed to be here.
of course, being in the privileged position of being an MIT student, along with all the privilege that brought me here in the first place, the question for me is why rather than why not. out of the million and one things that could’ve happened to me, this has been a good and kind one — filled with friends and things to do and so many memories. but all the other things that could’ve happened to me besides MIT — well, of course they would’ve been different, yet all these paths wouldn’t be less beautiful or fun for lack of MIT. i don’t deserve to be at MIT any more than i deserve to be on any of these other paths.
maybe i shouldn’t be putting so much thought into this question, since i also feel like it was flawed from the beginning. it implies an impartial arbiter for what should be and what shouldn’t be, and i’m inclined to say that it doesn’t exist. if anything, MIT admissions sure isn’t one.
who are you?
i don’t know either! i’m still trying to figure that out. but i suppose that’s part of the fun of life — figuring things out and making things up as you go along.","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-02_02h27_28-400x251.png', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7615-800x476.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2435-800x1025.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3270-800x475.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3567-800x707.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2429-1-800x1068.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3409-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2817-800x948.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9295-800x515.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2493-400x241.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3931-800x600.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4256-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4054-800x1420.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3571-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4293-800x600.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2589-400x220.jpg']"
The Small Things I Like About Autumn,Richard O. '28,2 ,"October 31, 2025","Autumn is arguably one of the best seasons there is, especially here in Cambridge. As someone who loves scenic views to take pictures, the colors of fall leaves mixed in with the unique and historic buildings across both our campus and Boston create a beautiful canvas and culture that I’ve come to fall in love with.  And recently, I’ve been trying to take more time to acknowledge all the small things around me that I enjoy but don’t really take the time to recognize, so below are some of the few things that make the fall season such a significant time of year for me.
The Leaves: One of the most memorable experiences about fall on the East Coast is watching the leaves change color.  The yellow, brown, and orange of the leaves, for me, always adds a new type of warmth to the world that makes everything feel so vibrant despite the decaying foliage that is almost impossible not to take a picture of when you walk by. (Check out Janet’s recent post to see what the fall colors look like here on campus). 
 
Fall Flavors: Walk into any coffee shop or cafe during the fall months, and they’ll be sure to have new menu items that mix in either Apple, Cinnamon, or Pumpkin flavors in a number of unique ways. I always find a sense of coziness whenever I’m enjoying something that uses one of the three – and also find myself consuming a little too much of it too.
 
Fall Clothes: I love sweatshirts, I love jackets, and I love hoodies. And though I probably wear them all throughout the year, the fall season is usually the perfect time to put them on as the weather is not too warm where the extra clothes make you sweat more, and not too cold that you need to layer them all under a puffer coat that makes you look like Baymax from Big Hero 6.
 
Thanksgiving: Arguably one of the best holidays of the year. In the past, my family and I would always watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade while everyone prepared different dishes for dinner, and I always had fun competing with my parents and siblings as we debated during the day whose dish would turn out the best. (It was always my mac and cheese).
 
The Cool Weather: In the hot vs. cold weather debate, I have always chosen the cold weather side for the argument that you can always layer up more to warm up in the cold, but you can only remove so much to cool down when it’s hot. And of course, winter in the northeast takes cold to an extreme, so fall is like the goldilocks zone.
 
Fall Walks: There’s absolutely nothing better than taking a walk in the fall breeze and enjoying the crunch of fallen leaves with every step – especially with friends or family. Going along the river at sunset is also really enjoyable when you can get a view of both the colorful earth and shiny blue Charles at the same time.
 
Halloween: Infinite candy (something people like Aidan are incapable of ranking accurately) and everyone unlocking their inner child and playing dress up. Need I say more?
 
Pre-Christmas: While fall is my favorite season, the best holiday-season takes place during the winter, and fall serves as the best opening performance before the Christmas lights and holiday music take over. You’ll probably find several Christmas decorations here or there during November, before the real deal takes place, too.

happy halloween! 🎃👻,Aiden H. '28,37 ,"October 31, 2025",,['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-30-at-10.24.25-AM-400x218.png']
Lost in other people’s stories,Allison E. '27,2 ,"October 28, 2025","I listen to a lot of audiobooks. In 2023, I listened to 28.6 days worth of audiobooks–while doing chores, while falling asleep, and sometimes even while doing psets. It’s something I’ve been doing since middle school, but I never really started thinking about the habit until coming to MIT. Why do I listen to so many audiobooks?
I think part of the reason is that there’s simply no kind of escapism like living inside someone else’s head. You get to experience what they experience–the fear during a dangerous situation, or the triumph of overcoming the impossible, or the rush falling in love. You’re thinking their thoughts and feeling their emotions and experiencing their highs and lows at just an arm’s breadth away. An arm’s breadth away is the perfect amount of distance for the human experience. It preserves the joy and the excitement and the intrigue, and it also protects you from the intensity of it all–from the kind of reality that slaps you round the head and seeps into the porous structure of your bones.
Living someone else’s life doesn’t just mean living through their experiences, though. It means you get to be that person for a little bit. You get to be that person who always has a quippy remark locked and loaded. You get to be that person with a genius idea for every predicament. You get to be that person so morally virtuous that they change the people around them.
Perhaps most importantly, living inside a book requires zero decisions. The story makes all the choices, and you get to just sit back and enjoy the ride. It’s especially a relief here at MIT, this big and scary place with an enormous amount of freedom. You have to make so many decisions–which classes to explore, which clubs to sink your time into, which people to build relationships with. Every decision feels like such a large fork in the road, and every choice feels weighty in a place that you’ve worked so hard to get to. In an audiobook? None of that is up to you.
I worry sometimes that the escapism is bad for me. That I spend so much time living in other people’s stories that I don’t have time to live my own. But sometimes I don’t entirely feel like living my own story.
I’ve occasionally tried to stop listening to audiobooks for periods of time. A cleanse, you might say. For a little bit, there are interesting thoughts that crop up throughout the day. But for the most part, it’s just boring. Sometimes I simply have no thoughts, and even when they do appear, the thoughts tend to start circling around and around in my head, descending into a state of nonsensicality. And then I hit a rough patch in life, and I end up escaping back into my audiobooks.
I don’t know if this is the best way to go about life, and there’s not much of a message here. Maybe a recommendation that if you’re also looking for a bit of escapism, try an audiobook. And maybe also a cautionary tale against escaping too thoroughly. :shrug:",[]
another day of fall,Janet G. '27,3 ,"October 25, 2025","This Monday, as many Mondays go, felt like a terrible start to my week. For starters, it was raining when I woke up. Also, I was running on like 5 hours of sleep from making my  7.06⁠01Cell Biology cheatsheet the night before and studying all weekend—but boy did I wake up when Canvas⁠02a learning management system that hosts assignments and grades and class materials, similar to schoology did not respond after my 10th page refresh.
I do not have a propensity for time management, and so had not attempted to download the practice exams before Monday morning; this led to some frantic texting of friends to attempt to acquire a copy of the practice exam and answers so that I wouldn’t be rawdogging the exam. Thankfully, my friends carried through⁠03thank you Jean and Sean for providing me separate last minute copies LOL and I survived another day in 7.06.
The exam happened, and I went back to my dorm to change out of my wet socks that were pissing me off. Canvas continued to be down, which did not help with studying for my Deep Learning midterm, but it did help with getting extensions for all my class assignments. With fresh socks, new extensions, and clear skies, I decided to finally touch some grass for the first time in ~2 weeks and go take a break.

Post-rain Cambridge felt particularly clear that afternoon. The rain finally washed the green foliage away in place for golds and reds, and for the first time this year I felt like we were in fall. It was so beautiful that I let myself wander for half an hour while my lectures for deep learning waited, trying to soak up all of this colourful warmth before the sun set.

Seasons do not change in the blink of an eye; the reality is probably that the fall colours had already burst along the esplanade before I looked across the river that day. But it is also true that my perception of the world changed that day, because the rain cleared the skies and Canvas shut down so I had an excuse to stop working and breathe. It is crazy how the Canvas software prevented me from noticing nature’s own canvas, but it is a sad fact that you must accept. To do well, you give some things up in place of others, and you must believe that it is worth it.
I’ve been thinking a lot about the internet and technology from taking Petey’s CMS.614⁠04Critical Internet Studies, a class I have thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend. It makes you think about the internet in ways that you don't expect – the dark underbellies and (seemingly) boring infrastructure – and gives us space to work through our ideas using projects and discussions. Shoutout Petey for allowing me to think about the world in not-hyper-optimized ways and fail in ways that I am glad to. , and I’ve been talking to friends about dormspam discussions on burnout and workload, and this whole story just feels uncanny in how it ties everything together. This is a school that pushes you to work hard, where you will probably grow to build and shape the technologies that come back to shape you, and these technologies will both prevent you from engaging with the world around you (as in assignments and youtube shorts) and help you preserve the beautiful moments when you see them (as in phone cameras). I’m glad I’m not really on social media anymore; sometimes I forget that my phone exists, which is one less battle I have to fight to get my attention back.
There’s something else tucked away in these thoughts too. Some emotions—bittersweet? ephermerality? nostalgia?
There’s something I wrote to my friends about the seasons last week:
winter is swiftly encroaching upon fall. the leaves have barely put on their red and yellow coats, and the sun already is impatiently casting its own golden beams onto the foliage. everything feels crisp at this time of year. the sky is blue in a way that always makes me sad. why must you be so brilliantly blue? why must you let the sun shine through but leave no warmth? why must you make me love you so much and miss you so deeply?
i always feel emotional around fall. there’s a bittersweetness about it; everything feels so temporary. we’re waiting for the end, the harvest, the next year where new beginnings begin. the days only get colder and colder and colder. the leaves decorate the trees until they fall into big piles at the root, until they fall away and snow begins decorating the branches, until that falls away too and all we have are barren branches and eerie silences
Today is the first day of family weekend. My family and the land I grew up in is thousands of miles away, in the part of the world that is blooming with daffodils and magnolias and kowhai for spring, in a country where the trees stand tall and evergreen and does not know why fall is a noun too. I have not been back in two years and Fall—or shall I say Autumn?—is the first season I learned to live alone in.

My midterms are mostly done now; my life is moving more slowly. Maybe I’ll finally have a chance to reflect on the bigger arcs of my life—ending my tenure in HackMIT, jumping more into research, being more responsible about my social life—and maybe I’ll write about them. But for now, I’m going to go walk by the river again, spend time with the people I love, and appreciate the vivid colours of nature’s canvas.","['https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1515-800x600.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1511-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1492-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1528-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1493-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1494-800x1067.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7891-1-800x600.jpg', 'https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4799-800x1067.jpg']"
